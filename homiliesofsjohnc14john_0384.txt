1'1‘3ms.aff01·ds unspeakable plcasure. And if he only calls him to
Ξ ‘' ⁸¹ remembrance, hc is roused in mind, and transportcd.

I spcak of real friends, men os one soul, who would even
die for each other, who love fervently. Do not, thinking of
those who barely love, who are tal)le-coinpanionS‚ mere
nominal friends, suppose that my discourse is resuted. If
any one has a friend such as I speak of, hc will acknowledge
the truth of my words. He, though he sees 1115 friend every
day, is not satiated. For him he prays for the same things
as for himself. I know one, who calling upon holy men in
behalf of his friend, besought them to pray first for him, and
then for himself. So dear a thing is a good friend, that
times and places are loved on his account. For as bodies
that are luminous spread their radiance to the neighboming
places, so also friends leave a grace of their own in the
places to which they have come. And ostentimes in the
absence of friends, as we have stood on those places, we
have wept, and remcmbering the days which we passed
together, have sighcd. It is not possible to represent by
speech, how great a pleasure the presence of friends affords.
But those only know, who have experiente. From friends
we may both ask a favour, and receive one without suspicion.
then they enjoin any thing to us, then we feel indebted to
them3 but when they are slow to do this, then we are
sorrowful. We have nothing which is not theirs. Often
despising all things here, on their account we are not willing

to depart hence, and they are more regretted by us than the
light.

(4) For, in good truth, a friend is more to be desired than the
light3 1 speak of a true one. And wonder not: for it were
better sor us that the sun should be extinguished, than that
we should be deprived of friends. Itis better to live in dark-
ness, than to be without friends. And] will tell you why.
because many who see the sun are in darkness, but they can
never be even in tribulation, who abeund in friends. I speak
of spiritual friends, who prefer nothing to friendship. Such
was Paul, 11110 would willingly have given his own soul, even

1ειεῖθ p, though not asked, nay would have plunged into hell¹ for
ἶῖοἷέ ῗῖἀ them. With so ardent a disposition ought we to love.
l wish to give you an example of friendship. Friends,
