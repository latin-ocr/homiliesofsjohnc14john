Unmereg'seclness keeps God's ‘mercyfivm us. 439

upon ourselves. WVhen we pray to God, saying‚ ‘ Lord, have Hom.
mercy upon me} let us say it to oumelves, and have morey IX.
upon ourselves. We are the arbiters‘ of God's having mercy
upon us. This grace He has bestowed upon us. If we do
things worthy of morey, worthy of the lovingkindness towards
us, God will have mercy upon us. But if we have not morey
on ourselves, who wil] spare us? Have mercy on thy neighbour,
and thou shalt find morey of God Himself. How many
every day come to thee, saying‚ ‘ Have pity on me,’ and thou
are not turned towards them 3 how many naked, how many
maimed‚ and we are not bowed toward them, but turn away
from their supplications. How then dost thou think to obtain
morey, when thou dost nothing thyself deserving of mercy?
Let us become mercifuL let us become pitisul‚ that so we
may please God, and obtain the good things promised to
those that love Him, by the grace and lovingkindness of our

Lord J esus Christ, with WVhom, διο.
