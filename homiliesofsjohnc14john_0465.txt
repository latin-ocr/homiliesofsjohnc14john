whether we die, or whether we live, we shall live with Him.

I hold this to be a matter of indifference: it is 110 concern of
mine, whether I live or die3 for we shall live with Him. Let

us therefore do every thing for that life ε looking 10 that, let

us do all 0111 works. Vice, O beloved, is darkness, it is death,

it is night. We see nothing that we ought, we do nothing
that becomes 115. Α5 1110 dead are unsightly and offensive,

so also the souls of 111050 who are vicious are sull of much
impurity. Their eyes 310 closed, their mouth is stopped, they
remain without motion in the bed of vice; or rather more
wretched than those who 310 naturally dead. For they truly

are dead to both, but these are insensible indeed to virtue,

but alive to vice. If 0110 should strike a dead man, he per-
ceives it not, he revenges it not. But as wood is dry ἰ, 50 15

numberless woundS, but has 110 feeling of any, but lies
insensible to every thing.

One would not err in comparing such men 10 those who
are mad, 01· drunk, 01· (1011110115. All these things belong to
vice, and it is worse than all these. He that is mad is much
allowed for by those who see him, for 1115 (1150350 15 not from
choice, but from nature alone. But how shall he be pardoned,
who lives in vice? thence then is vice? whence are the
majority bad? 117110110οἓ dost thou ask? do thou tell me,
Whence have diseases their evil nature? VVhence is phrensy?
Whenee is lethargy? Is it not from carelessness? If physical
disorders have 111011· origin in choice, much more those which
are voluntary. 1171101100 is drunkenness? Is it not froin
intemperance of seul? Is 1101 phrensy from excess of
fever? And is not sever from the elements too abundant in
us? And is not this superabundance of elements from our
carelessness? F or when either from deficiency 01 excess we
carry any of the things within us beyond the bounds os
moderation, we kindle that fire. Again, if when the fire is
kindled, we continue to neglect it, we make a conflagration
for ourselves, which we are not able 10 extinguish. So 15 11
