Uncertainty no evil to those who live in Liqht. 431

woman unexpectedly: for she knows that after nine months Hom.
the birth will take place. And yet it is very uncertain. For IX.
some bring forth at the seventh mouth, and others at the
ninth. And at any rate the day and the hour of birth is
uncertain. With respect to this therefore, Paul speaks thus.
And the image is just. For there are not many sure signs of
travail. For many have brought forth in the high roads, or
when out of their houses and abroad, not foreseeing it. And

he has not only glanced here at the uncertainty‚ but also at

the bitterness of the pain. For as she While sporting‚ laugh-

ing, not looking for any thing at all, being suddenly seized
with unspeakable pains‚ is pierced through with the pangs of
labour—so will it be with those souls, when that Day comes
upon them.

And they shall 7ιοί escape. And to shew them that he
does not speak this of thern, hc has added,

Ver. 4. But με, brethren, are not in darkness, that that
clay should over-take yon as α thies.

Here he speaks of a life that is dark and impure, for (3)
corrupt aud wicked men do all things as 111 the night, escap-
ing the notice of all, and inclosiug themselves in darkness.
For tell 1116, does not the adulterer watch for the evening, and
the thies for the night? Does not the violator of the tombs
carry on all his trade in the night? What then? Does it
not overtake them as a thies? Docs it not come upon them
too uncertainly? But do they know it beforehand? How
then does he say, Ye have πο need that Iuro-ite malo you?
He speaks here not with respect to the uncertainty‚ but with
respect to the calamity, that is, it will not come as au evil to
them. For it will come uncertainly indeed even to them,
but it will involve them iu no trouble. Thac that Day, he
says, should overlalce you αδ· (ι thiqf: For in the case of those
who are watching and who are 111 the light, if there should
be any entry of a robber, it cau do them 110 harm: so also it
is with those who live well. But those who are sleeping he
will strip of every thing, aud go ofl'3 that is, those who are
trusting in the things of this life. Then he adds another
thing 111 favour of them. For he adds,

Ver. 5. Ye are all, he says, [he children of lhe liyhl and
the children qs the day.
