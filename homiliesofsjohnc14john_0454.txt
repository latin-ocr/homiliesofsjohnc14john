then will they suffer it, if there be no hell?

Again‚ numberless other instances one might enumerate.
lVere not Ananias and Sappbira immediately punished‚
when they kept back part of what they had offered?
Has no ono then since that time been guilty of these
things? llow was it then that they did not suffer the same
punishment ?

Do we then persuade you that there is a hell, or do you
need more examples? Therefore we will proeeed also to
things that are unwritten‚ such as now take place in life.
For it is necessary that this notion should be gathered by
us from every quarter, that we may not, by vainly gratifying
ourselves„ do ourselves harm. Do you not see many visited
by calamities‚ maimed in their bodies, suffering infinite
troubles, but others in good repnte? For what reason do
some suffer punishment sor murders‚ and others not? Hear
Paul saying, Some men’s sins are open beforekand . . . and
some men they follow cister. How many murderers have
escaped! how many violators of the tombs! But let these
things pass. How many do you not see visited with the
severest punishment? Some have been delivered to a long
disease, others to continued tortures, and others to numberless
other ills. then therefore you see one who has been guilty
of the same things as they, or even much worse—and yet
not suffering punishment, will you not confess⁰‚ even against
your will, that there is a hell Ρ Reckon those here who before
you have been severely punished, consider that God is no
respecter of persons, and that though you have done num-
berless wickednesses‚ you have suffered no such thing, and
you will have the notion of hell. For God has so implanted
that notion within us, that no one can ever be ignorant of it.
For poets and philosophers and fabulists, and in short all men,
have philosophized concerning the retribution that is there,
and have said that the greater number are punished in
Hades. And if those things are sables, yet what we have
received are not so.

I say not these things as wishing to terrify you, nor to lay
a burden on your souls, but to make them wise, and render
