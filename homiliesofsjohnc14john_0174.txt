marriage, as Samson ἕ, yet not from marriage, but from their
own deliberate choice. Likewise in virginity, as the five
virgins. In wealth, as the rich man, who disregarded Lazarus:
in poverty, innumerable poor men even now are lost. In a
kingdom, I can point to many who have perished, and in
ruling the people. W ouldest thou see men saved in the
rank of a soldier? look to Cornelius; and in the government
of a family? look to the eunuch of the Ethiopian Queen.
Thus is it universally. If we use our wealth as is fit, nothing

Neither wealth, nor poverty, nor the having power, nor the
being subject to it, nor the pre-eminence in affairs, nor
disease, nor contempt, nor abandonment. But having left
all these things below, and upon the earth, it hastens
towards Heaven, only let the soul be noble, and nought
can hinder it from being virtuous. For when he who works
is in vigour, nothing external can hinder him; for as in
the arts, when the artificer is experieneed and persevering,
and thoroughly acquainted with his art, if dis-ease overtakes
him, he still hath it3 if he become poor, he still hath it;
whether he hath his tools in his hand or hath them not,
whether he works or worketh not, he loseth not at all his art:
sor the scienee of it is contained within him. Thus too the
