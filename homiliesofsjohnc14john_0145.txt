We should look to others' qood deeds, and om· ownsaults. 115

thus too is it in the case of your Teachers. When He HOM-
might have made them highly reverenced, He preferred that IX.
they should be subject to contempt for thy sake, that thou
mightest be able to profit, that thou mightest be able to be
rich. He is in want of the things of this life, that you may
abound in things spiritual. He hath shewn in many ways
that He might have made them above all want. But that
for thy sake He suffers them to be in want, this too He
shews in like sort. Knowing then these things, let 118 turn
ourselves to well doing, not to accusations. Let 118 not bc
over curious about the failings of others, but take account of
our own3 let us bear in mind the excellencies of other men,
while we reckon up our own faults, sor thus shall we be well-
pleasing to God. For he who looks at the faults of others,
and at his own excellencies, is injured in two ways3 by the
latter he is carried up to arrogance, through the former 116
falls into listlessness. For when he perceives that such an
one hath sinned, very easily will he sin himself ; when 116
perceives that he hath in ought excelled, very easily be-
cometh he arrogant. He who consigns to oblivion his own
excellencies‚ and looks at his failings only, whilst 116 18 a
curious enquirer of the excellencies, not the sins, of others, is
profited in many ways. And how ? Ι will tell you. WVhen
he sees that such an one hath done excellently, he 18 raised
to emulate the same3 when he sees that he himself hath
sinned, he is rendered humble and modest. If we act thus,
if we thus regulate ourselveS, we shall be able to obtain the
good things which are promised, through the grace and
lovingkindness of our Lord J esus Christ, with Whom, &m
