Meclaam'cal olgjections to the Resurrection. 409

suffered shipwreck and was drowned in the sea, and having Hom.
fallen many fishes caught him, and each of the fishes [lt--
devoured some member. Then of these very fishes, one was
caught in this gulph, and one in that, and this was eaten by

one man, and that by anothere. And again, those who ate

the fishes, that had eaten the man, died in different places,

and were themselves perhaps devoured by wild beasts. And——
when there has been so great a confusion and dispersion—

how shall the man rise again? Who shall collect the dust?

But wherefore dost thou say this, O m'an, and weavest strings

of trifles, and makest it a matter of perplexity? For tell ine,

if the man had not fallen into the sea, if the fish had not
eaten him, nor the fish again been devoured by numberless
men—but he had been preserved with care in a coffin, and
neither worms nor any thing else had disturbed him, how
shall that which is dissolved rise again? How shall the dust

and ashes be again conglutinated f? Whence shall there

be any more its bloom for the body? But is not this a diffi-
culty?

If indeed they be Greeks who raise these doubts, we shall
have number-less things to say to them. What then? For
there are among them those who convey souls into plants,
and shrubs, and dogs. Tell me, which is more easy, to
resume one's own body, or that of another? Others again
say that they are consumed by fire, and that there is a resur-
rection of garments and of shoes, and they are not ridiculed.
Others introduce atoms. But our argument is not with
those, but to the faithful, (if we ought to call them faithful
who raise questions‚) we will still say what the Apostle See
has said, that all life springs from corruption, all plants, all ῗὸοἶξὺἰ,
seeds. Seest thou not the fig tree, what a trunk it has, what ⁷
stems, how many leaves, and branches, stalks, and roots, oc-
cupying so much ground and ernbosomcd therein. This then,
such and so great as it is, springs from that grain which was
thrown into the ground and itself first corrupted. And isit
be not rotted and dissolved, there will be none of these

things Tell me, whence does this happen? And the vine
