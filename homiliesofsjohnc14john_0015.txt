PREFACE . v

Rev. F. Bowles, M.A. of Exeter College, and to the latter by
the Editor, which is noticed in order that the reader may
find the less difficulty from any difference in the heads
under which similar matter may be placed, as the two
were made simultaneously to save time.

A few points on which tho Editor was not informed

until the sheets were printed are noticed in the Addenda
and Corrigenda.
