To supply, he sayS, your Iaclc of service toward me.
What is this? the city was not present, but by sending him,
it fulfilled through him all its service toward me. He there-
fore supplied your lack of service, so that for this reason too
he deserves to enjoy much honour, since, what ye all should
have done, this hath he performed on your behalf. Here he
shews that there is also a highestk service to be rendered
by those in safety to those in danger, for so he calls it a
lael-7¹ of service, with reference to the former. Seest thou
the spirit of the Apostle? These words spring not from arro-
gance, but from his great care towards them, for he calls the
matter a service and a back, that they may not be puffed up,
but be moderate, nor think that they have rendered some
great thing, but rather be humble-ininded.

Momm. Let not us then think great things of ourselves when we
minister to the Saints, nor imagine that herein we confer a
favour 011 them, for this deed is owed by us to them as a
debt, and we do them no favour. For as supplies are due
by those who are in peace and not engaged in war to such
as stand in the army and fight, (for these stand on their
behoof,) thus too is it here. For if Paul had not taught,
who would have cast him into prison? thereforc we ought
to minister to the Saints. For is it not absurd to contribute
to an earthly king, when engaged in war, all that he wants, as
clothing and food, not according to his need alone, but
abundantly, whilst to the King of Heaven, when engaged in
fight, and contending against far more bitter foes, (for it is

Eph. 6, written, we veras-tle not ayainst fle-sle ancl blood) we will not

of man has greater force with us than hell, and the future
torments. For this cause, in truth, all things are turned
upside down3 for politica] affairs are daily accomplished
with much earnestncss, and wc will not be left behind, whilst
of spiritual things there is no account taken at all ; but the
things which are demanded os us of necessity, and with
