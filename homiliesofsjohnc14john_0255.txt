Man’s yreal alienation, and wonderful reconciliatekm. :225

And throughout he is shewing that the Angels had no power Ι-ΙΙξΤΜ·
in the successive times²; forasmuch as men continued ene- “
mies, and they could neither persuade them, nor, if persuaded,
could >they deliver them from the devil. For neither would
persuading them be any gain, except he that held them were
bound3 nor would binding him have been of any service,
except they whom he detained were willing to return. But
both of these were needed, and they could do neither of them,
but Christ did both. So that even more marvellous than loosing
death, is the persuading them. For the former was wholly
of Himself, and the power lay wholly in Himself, but of the
latter, not in Himself alone, but in us also3 but we aeconi-

ner of the reconciliation, that it was in tlte Bocly, and not by
being merely beaten, nor seourged, nor sold, but even by
dying a death the most shameful. Again he makes mention
of the Cross, and again lays down another benefit. For He
did not only delc'ver, but, as he says above, Wleso halle made v. 12·

death, he says, to present yon hely, and numanae-table, (md

delivered from sins, but hath also placed amongst the ap—
