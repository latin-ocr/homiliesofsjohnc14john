ITHES- VVherefore, l beseech you, let us guard against this sin.
1:1'02‘3‘ For as we punish women, when, being married to us, they
'give themselves to others, so also are we punished‚ though not
by the Romanss laws, yet by God. For this also is adultery.
For not only is adultery committed in doing so by her who
is married to another, but by him also, who is yoked to a
wife. Attend carefully to what I say. For although what
is said is offensive to many, it is necessary to be said, to set
the matter right sor the future. But not only is this adul-
tery, when we defile a woman who is married to a man; but
if we ourselves being married to a woman defile one who is
free and disengaged, the matter is adultery. For what, if
she with whom the adultery is committed is not bound?
Yet art thou bound. Thou hast transgressed the law. Thou
hast injured thine own flesh. For tell me, wherefore dost
thou punish thy wife, if she commit fornication with a man
who is loosed‚ and has not a wife? Because it is adultery.
Yet he who defiled her has not a wife, but she is bound to
a husband. Well then, thou also art bound to a wife3 so
that in like manner thy offence also is adultery. For it is
Matt.5‚ said, leoever slzall put away lzis πρῖε, savz'ny for tlze cause
32· (sfornieatz'orz, causeam lzer to commit adultery ; and who-50-
ever shall marry ker that is divorced, committent adultery.
If he who marries her who is divorced commits adultery‚ he
who, with a wife of his own, defiles himself also with that
other, how doth not he much more commit it? It is mani-
fest to every one. But perhaps to you who are men, enough
has been said on this subject. For concerning them that
Mark 9, are such, Christ also said, Where their worm elieth, not,
⁴¹4· and tlte fire is not quencked. But for the sake of the young
it is necessary to speak to you, or rather not so much on
their account as on yours. For these things are suitable not
to their case only, but to yours also. And how? 1 will now
tell you. He who has not learnt to commit fornication, will
neither know how to commit adultery. But he who wallow-
eth among harlots‚ will quickly also arrive at the other, and

will dcfile himself, if not with the married, yet with those who
