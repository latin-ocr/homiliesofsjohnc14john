4, ¹¹¹ enviest, fightest with the Church, thou warrest with God.
For, since with the good repnte of thy brother is interwoven
also the Chureh's profit, need is, that if the one be undone,
the other shall be undone also. So that, in this regard, thou
doest a deed of Satan, seeing thou plottest mischief against
the body of Christ. Thou art pained at him¹¹ that hath in
nothing wronged thee; yea, much rather, at Christ. WVherein
hath He wronged thee, that thou wilt not suffer His body to
be decked with beauty? that thou wilt not suffer His bride
to be adorned? Consider, I pray thee, the punishment, how
sore. Thou gladdenest thine enemies 3 and him too himself,
the well-reputed of, whom through thy envy thou wishest to
grieve, thou dost the rather gladden3 thou dost by thine envy

wouldest not have envied him. Thou shewest the rather that
thou art in punishment.

I am ashamed indeed to exhort you from such motives,
but seeing our weakness is so great, let us be instructed even
from these, and free ourselves from this destructive passion.
Grievest thou that he is in good esteein? then why swellest
thou that esteem by envying? iVishest thou to punish him?
Why then shewest thou that thou art pained? thy punish
thyself before him ⁰, whom thou wouldest not have well
esteemed of? Thereafter double will be his pleasure, and thy
punishment3 not only because thou provest him to be great3

metm-215 but because thou begettest¹ in him yet another pleasure, by
punishing thysels 3 and again, at what thou art pained, he is
pleased‚ whilst thou enviest. See how we deal ourselves
heavy blows without perceiving itl—But he is an enemy.
And yet, why an enemy? What wrong hath he done? Still,
however, by this we make our enemy the more illustrious, and
thereby punish ourselves the inore. And herein again we
punish ourselves, if we have discovered that he knows it.
