104 Epaphrodilecs leissellow-soldier. His sicltness.

Ver. 25. Yet I supposed it mec-essary to send to you
Epaphroditus, my brother, (md companion in ἰαῦοιιν, and
sellom-soldier.

And him too 116 sends with the same praises as Timothy‚
for he commcnds him on these two points3 first, in that he
love-d them, when he sayS, who will naturally care-sor μου,-
and secondly, in that he had approved himself in the Gospel.
And for the same reason, and in the same ternas, he praises

sorrow upon sorrow.

Here he aims at a farther point, making ite manifest, that
Epaphroditus too was well aware, how he was beloved of
them. And this is no light thing toward drawing us on to
love. How is it shewn? He was sick, he says, and ye
grieved. He hath recovered from sickness, and freed you
from that grief, which ye had by reason of his sickness. Yet
not even so was he himself freed from his sorrow, but was
pained, in that on his recovery from health he saw you not f.
