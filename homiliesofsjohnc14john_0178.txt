Learn how great is the power of the Cross. How many
goods it hath attained, and doth still: how it is the safety of
our life. Through it all things are done. Baptism is through
the Cross, for we must receive that seal. The laying on of
hands is through the Cross. If we are in the way, if we are
at home, wherever we area, the Cross is a great good, the
armour of salvation, a shield which cannot be beaten down,
a weapon to oppose the devi13 thou bearest the Cross when
thou art at enmity with him, not simply when thou sealest
thyself by it, but when thou sufferest the things belonging to

cause the evil was urgent, because such deserve tears. Of a
truth the luxurious are worthy of tears, who make fat that
which is thrown about them, Ι mean the body, and take no
thought of that soul which must give account. Behold thou
livest delicately, behold thou art drunken, to-day and to-
morrow, ten years, twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred, which is
impossible3 but if thou wilt, let us suppose it. What is the
end? that is the gain? Nought at all. Doth it not then
deserve tears, and lamentations, to lead such a life, God
hath brought us into this course, that He may crown us, and
we take our departure without doing any noble action.
Wherefore Paul weepeth, where others laugh, and live in
pleasure. So feeling is he: such thought taketh he for all
men. leose flod, saith he, is their belly. For this have
