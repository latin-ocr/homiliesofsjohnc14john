Glory of Cla-ist is tlte ylory of tlte Father. 83

this is plain from hence. Is this ¹, tell me, glory? Therefore ¹ hestiis

angels, He was not in glory. If this be the glory which
is above every glory, (for this is the meaning of above every
name) though He were in glory before, yet was He in
glory inferior to this. It was for this then that He made the

 

things that are, that He might be raised to glory, not from
His own goodness, but because He required glory from us!
See ye not their folly? see ye not their impiety?

Now if they had said this of Him that was incarnate, there
had been reason, for God the Worc1¹¹ allows that this be said
of His flesh. It touches not His divine nature, but has to
do altogether with the dispensation. But if thisbe explained
of His divinity, no pardon remains for such impiety. So

when the Son is dishonoured, the Father is dishonoured also.
If this be so with us, where the difference is great between
fathers and sons, much more in respect of God, where there
is no difference, doth honour and dishonour Ρ pass on to Him.
If the world be subjected to the Son, this is glory to the
Father. And so when we say that He is perfect, want-
ing nothing, and not inferior to the Father, this is glory to the
Father. This is a great proof of His power, and goodness,
and wisdom, that He begat such a Son, no whit inferior,
neither in goodness nor wisdom. When I say that He is
wise as the Father, and no whit inferior, this is a proof of
