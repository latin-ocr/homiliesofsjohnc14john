from such a marriage there will spring good things innume-

evils l The banquet hall is no sooner broken up, than straight-

been lost, and there succeeds to tho pleasure melancholy in-
tolerable. But this distress belongs to the mother-in-law ¹,—
nay, rather not even is the bride herself sree3 all that follows
at least belongs to the bride herself. For to see all broken
up, is a ground sor sadness3 to see the house desolate, is an
occasion for dejection.

There is Christ, here is Satan3 there is cheerffilness, here
anxious care3 there pleasure, here pain3 there expense, here
nothing of the kind3 there indecency, here modesty3 there
envy, here no envy3 there drunkenness, here soberness,
health, temperance. Bearing in mind all these things, let us
stay the evil at this point, that we may please God, and be
counted worthy to obtain the good things promised to them
that love Him, through the grace and love toward man of our
Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, to the Father, together with
the H oly Ghost‚ be glory, power, honour, now and for ever,
and world without end. Amen.
