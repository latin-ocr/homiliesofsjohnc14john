310 Wisdom toward those without, and toward divers estates.

Coros. shouldest be bold; but when without, thou oughtest not to
‘¹' ¹¹· be so.

Secst thou how every where he speaks of those without,

the Greeks? WVheiesore also u hen writing to Timothy, he

1'1im. said, Mor-·‚eozet he must hare a (Jood report of them which

{³07OE are without. And again, For what lccwe I to do to judye

⁵ 12. istem aleo (leat are without. Walk in wisdom, he saith,

tou-ard them that are without. For without, they are, even

though they live in the same world with us, seeing they are

’.Μα- without the kingdom, and the paternal mansion'. And he

'‘⁶'‘ ⁹2⁶· comforts them u 1th‘tl by calling the others without, as he

Ceffliss said abox e, Your lzfe is leid with C'lerz'st in God.

Then, he saith, seek ye gloiy, then honours, then all those
other things, but not so nove, but give them up to those with-
out. Then, lest thou think that he is speaking os money, he
adds, Let your speech be always with ,φφ-αρε, seorsoned with

Seest thou not how Daniel payeth court to an impious man?
Seest thou not the three children, how wisely they bore

ἠδ’- themselves towards2 the king, shewing both courage, and

so it had not been boldness, but vainglory. Tlcat ye may

S. Greg. ruler ought to be answered in one way, the ruled in another,
{affut the rich in one way, the poor in another. WVherefore ? Be·
cause the souls of those who are rich, and in authority, are
weaker, more inflammable, more fluctuating, so that towards

them, one should use condescension3 those of the poor, and

the ruled, firmer and inore intelligent, so that to these one

ought to use greater boldness of speech 3 looking to one thing,

their edification. Not that because one is rich, another

poor, the former is to bc honoured more, the latter less, but

nmen- because os his weakness, let the former be supported³, the
