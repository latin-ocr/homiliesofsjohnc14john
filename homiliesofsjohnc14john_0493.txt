ARGUMENT.

HAVING said in 1113 former Epistle that ue pray m‘ylzt ancl From
day to see you, and that we could not forbear, but ‘cc-ere [⁶773] ΙΤΞΕΙςό
in Athens alone, and that I sent Timotheus, by all these ⁷ ¹ ⁸ ⁰
expressions he shews the desire which he had to come
amongst them. When therefore he had perhaps not had
time¹ to gc, nor to perfect what was lacking in their saith, on ¹ οὐκ
this account he adds a second Epistle, filling up by his ‘Mam'
writings what was wanting of his presence. For that he did
not dcpart, we may conjecture from hence: sor he says in
this Epistle‚ We beseecle. you by the centius] of our Lora} 2 Thes.
‚Iesus christ. For in his first Episue he said, Ostha> timesfflfflffl
ancl seasons ye leave 720 need that I write mzlo you. So that 5, 1·
if he had gone, there would have been no need of 1113 writing.

But 311166 the question was deferred³‚ on this account he

adds this Epistle, 33 3130 111 1113 Epistlo to Timothy he says,

They subvert tlzefaitlz of some, sayz'nf) that tlze Resurrection from
is already past. And this they did, that tho faithful hence· ἔξξῇ
forth hoping for nothing great 01· splendid, might faint under

their sufferings.
