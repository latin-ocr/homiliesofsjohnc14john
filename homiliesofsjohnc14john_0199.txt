As he said when in bonds, Y e all are partalsers ofmy yrace. ΗοΜ.

vot only to believe, but also to swffer for His Name. For lb. 29.
since those former words by themselves had power to
grieve them, he consoleth them, and receiveth them, and
praiseth them again. And this in measured words. For he

said not, ‘ gave,⁷ but communicat-ed, to shew that they too
were profited by becoming partakers of his labours. He

said not, ye did lighten, but ye did communicate with my
affliction, which was a more worthy thing. Seest thou the

Lo, how great is his commendation! For the Corinthians
and Romans are stined up by hearing these things from him,
whilst they did it without any other Church making a begin-
