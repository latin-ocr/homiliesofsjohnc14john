com-erninq zeal, perseeutiny tlte Olmrehv. This last he says,
because the first alone is not sufficient to shew the force of
the rather. For it is possible to be a Pharisee even, and yet
not very zealous. Aeeorcliny to riykteousness. Since it
is possible to be adventurous, or to 361 thush from ambition,
and no‘t out of zeal for the law, as the High Priests did. Yet
he was 110 such person, but, accordiny to tlte riylzteousness
which is in tlze law, blameless. If then both for purity of
descent, and earnestness, and habits, and mode of life, I
surpassed all, why have I renouneed 311 111056 (1131111165, 116

A course of life thus strictly regulated, and entered upon Monat-

dangers, plots, labours, forwardness, did Paul renounce,

win Christ. But we do not even contemn money, that we
may win Chri-st, but prefer to fail of the life to 601116 rather
than of the good things of the present life. And yet this is
nothing· else than loss3 for tell me now, let us examine in de-
tail the conditions of riches, and see whether it be not loss
accompanied with inexpressible trouble, and without any
gain. For tell me, what is the advantage of those stores of

in them? None, nay, we are only losers. How so? Because
even the poor man, in his cheap and threadbare clothing,
does not bear the scorching in time of heat any wise worse
than yourself, nay, rather he bears it better, for clothes that
are threadbare and worn single allow more ease to the body,
but not so with those which are new made, though they be
finer than the spider's web. Resides, you, from your excessive
sels-importance, wear even two and three inner garments, and
often a cloak and girdle, and breeehes 100, but no one blames
him if he wears but a single shirt; so that he is the man that
bears the 11631 111051 easily. It is owing to 11115 11131 we see
