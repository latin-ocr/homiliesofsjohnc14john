God approved, so also we remain. It is a proof of this our
virtue, that we are entrusted with the Gospel. But if there

had been any thing bad in us, God would not have approved

us. But the expression that He approved us, implies, here,

that He found us trustworthy¹ and trusted us. It is not, to masma,-
