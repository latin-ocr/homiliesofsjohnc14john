Now henceforward he is hastening and in pangs to ‘² enter {gr P‘eg·
upon the doctrine, neither accusing them, nor clearing them offaliinoii
accusation. I have α corgflz'ct, he saith. That what may betheir ‘³³
brought to pass, that they ³ may be knit together. What he ³So Sav.
means is this3 that they may stand firm in the faith. He ‘BQ’
doth not however so express himself 3 but extenuatos the
matter of accusation. That is, that they may be united with
love, not with necessity nor with force. For as I have said,
he always avoids offending, by leaving it to themselvesg 3 and
therefore he saith, I leave a corfflict, because Ι wish it to be
with love, and willingly. For I do not wish them to be
brought together merely, not with their lips merely, but tlcat

but malo all riclzes ; that your full assurance may be intense,
as well as in all things. And observe the wisdom of this
blessed one. He said not, ‘ Ye do ill that ye are not fully
assured,⁷ nor accused the1n3 but, ye know not how desirous Ι
am that ye may be fully assured, and not merely so, but with
understanding. For seeing he spoke of faith 3 suppose not, he
saith, that Ι meant barely and unprofitably, but with under-
standing and love. To tlte acknowledyment qftlee mystery
