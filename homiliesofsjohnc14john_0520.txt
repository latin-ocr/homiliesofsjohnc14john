2, 3. this you ought more especially to attend, because they are

the same things, because we give you no labour, nor speak

things that are strange or variable. What then, since you

say, that those are the same things, but our diseourses are

not the same things, but we always speak things that are new

to you, do you pay hced to these? By no means. But if

we say, Why do you not retain even these? ‘ We have heard

them but once‚' you say, ‘ and how ean we retain them? If

we say, thy do ye not attend to them ? ‘ The same things‚'

you say, ‘ are always said'—and every way your words are

those of sloth and excuse. But these excuses will not always

Serve, but there will be a time when we shall lanient in vain

and without effect. Which may God forbid, and grant that

having repented here, and having with understanding and

godly sear attended to the things spoken, we may be urged on

to the due performance of good works, and may amend our

own lives with all diligence, that we may be able to obtain the

blessings promised to those who love Him, by His grace and
lovffigkindness, &e.
