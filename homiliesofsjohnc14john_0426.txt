But as ἶσαι-111719 brotlzerly love, με need not that I write unto
you .· for yc yourselves are tcczcylzt of God to love one another.

VVHY then having discoursed with them earnestly concern-
ing chastity, and being about to discourse about the duty
of working, and about the not sorrowing for the departed,
does he introduce that which was the principal of all good
things, love, as if he were passing it over, saying, we have no
need to write to you? This also is from his great wisdom,
and belongs to spiritual instruction. For here he shews two
things. First‚ that the thing is so necessary, as not to require
instruction. For things that are very important are manifest
to all. And secondly, by saying this he makes them inore
ashamed than if hc had adnionished them. For hc who
thinks that they have behaved aright, and therefore does not
admonish them, even if the)v had not behaved might, would
the sooner lead them to it. And observe, he does not speak
of love towards all ³, but os that towards the brethren. We
lzave 710 need lo write unio yon. He ought then to have been
silent, and to say nothing, if thero was no need. But now

¹¹ φιλαδελφία, is strictly ⁴ lovingness toward brethren‚' not merely ‘ as of
brethren.'
