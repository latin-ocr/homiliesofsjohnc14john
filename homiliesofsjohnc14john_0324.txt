needed to be instrueted in high doctrines as yet lacking to
them, or because that for persons who had been comforted
under trials, it were superfluous to hear on these subjects.
So that Ι conjecture, that in this place the Church was
now well-grounded, and that these things are said as in

Ver. 18. Wives, be szcly'ect to your husbands, as it is fit
in tlte Lord.

That is, be subject for God's sake, because this adorneth
you, he saith, not them. For I mean not that subjection
which is due to a master, nor yet that alone which is of
nature, but that for God's sake.

Ver. 19. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter
aqam-st them.

See how again he has enjoined reeiprocity ². As he there
enjoineth both sear and love, so also doth 110 here. For it is
possible sor one who loves even, to be bitter. What he
saith then is this. Fight not; for indeed ¹² nothing is more
bitter than this fighting, when it takes place on the part
of the husband toward the wife. For the fightings which
happen between beloved persons, these are bitter3 and
he shews that it ariseth froin great bitterness, when, saith he,
any one is at variance with his own member. To love there-

contributes his own part, all stands firm. For from being
loved, the wife too becomes affectionate³; and from her
being submissive, the husband becomes gentle. And see
how in nature also it hath been so ordered, that the one
should love, the other obey. For when the party governing
loves the governed, then every thing stands fast. Love from
the governed is not so requisito, as from the governing
towards the governed3 sor from the other obedience is due.

nothing else than that sor the sake of love it hath been made
so. Do not therefore, because thy wife is subject to thee,
