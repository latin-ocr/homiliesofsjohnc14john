- crown is not only 101· him that striveth, but 101 1110 11011101,

and the attendant, and all that help 10 prepare the combatant.
For they that strengthen him, and recover him, may fairly
share in his victory. And in wars 100, 1101 only he that wins
the prize of valour, but all they too that aid him, may fairly
claim a share in the trophies, and partake 01 1110 glory, as
having shared in his conflict by their attendance on him.
For it availeth 1101 0 little to wait on saints, but very much.
F or it makes us partakers of the rewards that are laid up for
them. Thus3 suppose 801110 0110 hath given up great pos-
sessions for God, is entirely dedicated to God, practises great
virtue, and even to words, and even to thoughts, and even in
every thing observes extreme strictness. It is open to thee
100, even without shewing such strictness, to have a share in
the rewards that are laid up for him for these things. How?
If thou aid him both in word and deed. If thou encourage
him both by supplying his needs, and by doing him every
possible service. For then the smoother 01 1118 rugged path
will 110 thyself. So then 11 ye admire those in the deserts that
have adopted an angelic 1110, 111080 111 1110 Churches that prac-
tise the same virtues with them, 11 ye admire, and are grieved
that ye are far behind them3 ye may, in another way, 1101-10110
with them, by waiting on them, and aiding them. For indeed
this too is 01 God’s lovingkindness, 10 bring those that
are less zealous ¹¹, and are not able 10 undertake the hard and
rugged and 811101 1110, 10 bring, I say, even 111080, by another
way, into the same order with the others. And this Paul
means bysellowslzip. They give a share 10 118, 110 11100118, 111
carnal things, and we give a share to them in spiritual things.
F 01 if Gssod 101 little and 1101-1111088 things grauteth the king-
dom, His servants 100,101 little and material things, give a share
in spiritual things: 01· ratherit is He that giveth both the one and
the other by means os them. Canst thou not fast, nor be alone,
nor lie on the ground,nor watch allnight? Yet mayest thou gain
