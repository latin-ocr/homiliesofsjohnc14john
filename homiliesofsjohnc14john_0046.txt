Pau„ F or if he that is simply hungry should be fed, much more when
¹> 7‘ 116 15 a saint too that is hungry. Isthen he is a saint, but notin
need, give not3 for this were no gaiu. For neither did Christ en-

join it; or rather neither is he a saint‘, that is in abundance

and receiveth. Seest thou that it is not for filthy lucre that

these things have been said to you, but for your profit? Feed

the hungry, that thou mayest not seed the fire of hell. 116,

Luke eating of what is thine‚ sanctifies also what remains. Think
¹¹⁷ 4¹· how the widow maintained Elias: she did not more seed than
she was sed: she did not more give than receive. This also

now takes place, and a much greater thing¹¹. For it is not a

1 Kingsbarrel of φηθαί, 1101 α cruse of oic, but what? 1472 hundred

29. She was a widow, famine pressed‚ and none of these things
lKings hindered her. Children too she had, and not even so was
¹7⁷ 12. she withheld. This woman became equal to her that cast 111
1116 two mites. She said not to herself, ⁶ that shall I receive

from this man? He stands in need of me. If he had any
power he had not hungered‚ he had broken the drought, he

had not been subject to like sufferings. Perchance he too
offends God.' None of these things did she think of. Seest

thou how great a good it is to do well with simplicity‚ and not

to be over curious about the person benefited? If she had
chosen to be curious‚ she would have doubted3 she would

not have believed. So too Abraham, if he had chosen to be
carious, would not have received angels. For it cannot, in-

deed it cannot be, that one, who is exceeding nice in these
matters, should ever meet with a saint. No: such an one
usually lights on impostors3 and how that is, I will tell you*

The pious man is not desirous to appear pious, and does not
clothe himself in show, though he be likely to be rejected.

But the impostor, as he makes a business of it, puts on a deal

of piety, that is hard to see through, so that while he who

does good even to those who seem not pious will sall 111 with

those who are so, he who seeks out those who are thought

10 1)6 pious, will often fall in with those who are not so.
Wherefore‚ Ι beseech you, let us do all things in simplicity.
