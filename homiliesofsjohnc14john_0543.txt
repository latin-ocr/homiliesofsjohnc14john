thy hand. Whatever useful things thou hast heard, these, Hom.
like the swallows, bearing off in thy mouth, carry away and ⁰
place them in the mouth of the mother and the young ones.

For how is it not absurd, in other things to think thyself
worthy of the preeminence, and to occupy the place of the
head, but in teaching to quit thy station. The ruler ought

not to excel the ruled in honours, so much as in virtues.

For this is the duty of a ruler, for the other is the part of the
ruled, but this is the achievement¹ of the ruler himself. If ¹ κατὸρ·
thou enjoyest much honour, it is nothing to thee, for thou Μαι
receivedst it from others. If thou shinest in much virtue,

this is all thine own.

Thou art the head of the woman, let then the head regu-
late the rest of the body. Dost thou not see that it is not so
much above the rest of the body in situation, as in fore-
thought, directing like a steersman the whole of it? For in
the head are the eyes both of the body, and of the soul.
Hence flows to them both the faculty of seeing, and the power
of directing. And the rest of the body is appointed for
service, but this is set to command. All the senses have
thence their origin and their source. Thence are sent forth
the organs of speech, the power of seeing, and of smelling,
and all touch. For thence is derived the root of the nerves
and the bones. Seest thou not that it is superior in foresight
more than in honour? So let us rule the women, let us
surpass them, not by seeking greater honour from them, but
by their being more benefited by us.

I have shewn that they afford us no little benefits, but if
we are willing to make them a return in spiritual things, we
surpass them. For it is not possible in bodily things to offer
an equivalent. For what? dost thou contribute much wealth?
but it is she who preserves it, and this care of hers is an
equivalent, and thus there is need of her. WVhereforc? Be-
cause many, who had great possessionS, have lost all because
they had not one to take care of them. But as for the
children, you both communicate, and the benefit from each
is equal. She indeed in these things rather has the more
laborious service, always bearing the offspring, and being
affiicted with the pains of childbirth; so that in spiritual

things only wilt thou be able to surpass her.
