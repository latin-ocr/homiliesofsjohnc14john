Christ still suff‘eriny in His Ministersfor the Checrch. 227

This also contributes to make it credible3 I, saith he, Paul Hom.

And what is the connexion of this? It seems indeed not (o)
to be connected, but it is even closely so. And minister, he
says, that is, bringing in nothing from myseff, but announc-
ing what is from another. And I so believe, that 1 suffer
even for His sake, and not suffer only, but even rejoice in
suffering, looking stedfastly unto the hope which is to come,
and I suffer not for myself, but for you. Andfill up, he
saith, that which is behind Qf the szfferinys of Christ in my

lieutenant should succeed to his wounds until the battle wele
