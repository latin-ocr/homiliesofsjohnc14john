Primitive Christians. Friends love to seem indebted. 355

that is, friends according to Christ, surpass fathers and sons. Hom.
For tell me not of friends os the present day, since this good SE·—
thing also has past away with others. But consider, that in
the time of the Apostles, I speak not of the chief men, but of
the believers themselves generally, all, he says, were of one Afss J,
beart ancl one seul, neither said any of them that ozcyhtof the 32' 3³‘
tlzz'nqs urlzielz lze possessed was leis own . . . . . and distribution
was made mzto every man, aceordz‘nq ers he laad need. There
were then no such words as ⁴ mine' and ‘ thine.⁷ This is
friendship, that a man should not consider his goods his own,
but his neighbour's, that his possessione belong to another3
that he should be careful of his friend's soul ¹¹¹, even as of his
own, and that his friends should 111 like manner shew the
same disposition towards him.

And where is it possible that such an one should be found?
Nay, it is not possible because we have not the will, since if
we were willing it is abundantly possible. For if it were not
possible, neither would Christ have commanded it, nor have
discoursed so much concerning love. A great thingis friend-
ship, and how great, no one can know, and no discourse
represent, but experience itself. It is this¹ that has caused¹i.e·the
heresies. This makes the Greeks still to be Greeks. He 171110ἷῖΞὲᾖ of
loves does not wish to command, nor to rule, but is rather
obliged when he is ruled and commanded. He wishes rather
to bestow a favour than to receive one, for he loves, and is
so affected, as not having satisfied his desire. He is not so
much gratified when good is done to him, as when he is doing
good. For he wishes to oblige, rather than to be indebted to
him; or rather he wishes both to be beholden to him, and to
have him his debtor. And he wishes both to bestow favours,
and not to seem to bestow them, but himself to be the debtor.
I think that perhaps many of you do not understand what has
been said: it is necessary therefore to say it again. He wishes
to be the first in bestowing benefits, and not to seem to be the
first, but to be returning a kindness. Which God also has done
in the case of men. He purposed to give His own Son for us3
but that He might not seem to bestow a favour, but to be 111-

debted to us, He commanded Abraham to offer his son, that {222 (lign-
