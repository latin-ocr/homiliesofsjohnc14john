asked from willing minds, and as if from free men, are all
deficient. I speak not against all, but against those who are
behind-hand with these supplies. For might not God have
made these contributions compulsory? Yet He would not,
for He has more care of you than of those whom you support.
Wherefore He would not that you should contribute of
necessity, since there is no recompence there. And yet
many of those who stand here are lower mindedm than the
Jews. Consider how great things the Jews gave, tithes ¹¹,
first-fruits, tithes again, and again other tithes, and besides
this thirteenths, and the shekel, aud no one said, how much
they devour, for the more they receive, the greater is your
reward. They said not, Much do they receive. They are
gluttons, which words Ι hear now from some. Such of us,
while they are building· houses, and buying estates, still think
they have nothing; but if any priest is clothed in dress more
bright than usual, and enjoys more than what is necessary
for his sustenance, or has an attendant, that he may not be
forced himself to act unbecomingly, they set the matter down
sor riches. And in truth we are rich even at this rate, and
they admit it against their will; sor we, though we have but
little, are rich, whilst they, though they get every thing about
them, are poor.

How far shall our folly extend? does it not suffice to our
punishment that we do no good deed, but must we add to it
the punishment of evil speaking? Foris what he has were
your gifts, you lose your reward by upbraiding him for what
you gave. In a word, if thou didst give it, why dost thou
upbraid him ? You have already borne witness to his poverty,
by saying that what he has are your gifts. thy then dost
thou upbraid? Thou shouldest not have given, didst thou
intend so to do. But dost thou speak thus, when another
gives? lt is then more grievous, in that when thou thyself
hast not given, thou upbraidest sor another man’s good deeds.
How great reward thinkest thou those who are thus spoken
