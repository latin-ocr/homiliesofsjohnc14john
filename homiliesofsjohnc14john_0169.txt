that is the meaning of tlez's one thinq—sbryettt'ny [hose thinys

speaking thus, he shews what it was which made him
reach forward unto the things which are before. He then,
who thinks that all is accomplished, and that nothing is
wanting to him sor the perfecting of virtue, may cease
from mnning, as having apprehended all. But he who
thinks that he is still distant from the goal, will never

great eagerness, without relaxation. As far as 0116 who so
runs differs from him who lies supine, so far doth Paul
differ from us. He died daily, he was reproved daily, there
