Genle'les, that they miylzt be saved. It is a mark of envy
therefore to hinder the salvation of all. To fill up their sins

These things are not like the former. There is here no return
back, no limit. But the wrath is nigh at hand. VVhence is this
manifest? From that which Christ soretold. For not only
is it a consolation to have partakers in our afflictions, but to

their parents, not only from the feelings of nature itself, but
also on account of their deserted state, so truly do we too

count oftheir separation. And this we cannot say, hc says,
that we have waited a long period, butsor a slzort time, and
