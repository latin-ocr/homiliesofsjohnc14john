‘262 l 'anily (s wealth und ef laeonoursrom it.

CoLos. hath passed by. And like as the dust is raised by our feet,
3’2’ so truly are these magistraeies also produced hy those who
are engaged about money, and in the whole of lise have the
rank and condition of feet; and like as the dust when it is
raised occupies a large portion of the air, though itself be
buta small body, so too doth power, and like as the dust
blindeth tho eyes, so too (10111 1116 pride of power bedim the

eyes of the understanding.

But what? Wilt thou that we examine that object of many
prayers, wealth? Come, let us examine it in its several
parts. It hath luxury, it hath honours, it hath power. First
then, if thou wilt, let us examine luxury. Is not this dust?
yea, rather, it hurrieth by swifter than dust, for the pleasure
of luxurious living reaeheth only to the tongue, and when
the belly is filled, not to the tongue even. But, saith one,
honours are of themselves pleasant things. Yet what can be
less pleasant than that same honour, when it is rendered
with a view to money? WVhen it is not from sree 6110166 and

could they possibly in any other way have so dishonoured

seeing it is more honoured than are its very possessors, and a

absurd that we are not eounted of as much value as earth and
ashes, (for such is gold,) but that we are honoured sor its
sake? With reason. But not so he, that despiseth wealth ;
for it were better not to be honoured at all, than 50 honoured.
For tell me, were one to say to thee, Ι think thee 11011111ν ofno
honour at all, but sor thy servants' sakes Ι honour thee, could
now any thing be worse than this dishonour? But if to be
honoured sor the sake of servants, who are partakers of the
same 50111 and nature with ourselves, be a disgrace, much
more then is it such, to be honoured sor the sake of meaner
things, such as the walls and 6011115 of 11011565, and vessels of
gold, and garments. A scorn indeed were this, and shame;
