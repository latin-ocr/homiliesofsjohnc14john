3²³ng- pieces of silver! Do ye not remember what I said before,

“’ ⁰* ' that covetousness is not shewn in receiving much, but rather
in receiving little things? See how great a crime 110 00111-
mitted sor a little gold, rather not sor gold, but for pieccs of
011101.

It cannot, it cannot bc that an avaricious 111011 should ever
sce the sace os Christ! This is one of the things which are
impossible. It is the root of evils, and if he that possesses
one evil thing, falls froin that glory, where shall he stand
who bears with him the root. He who is the slave of money,
cannot be a true servant of Christ. Christ Hiinself 110111

Matt. 6‚decla1·0d that the thing is impossible. Ye cannot, He says,
24‘ serre Gocl and Mammon, and, No man can serre two masters,
sor they lay upon us contrary orders. Christ says, “ Spare

the poor 3³⁷ Mammon says, ‘⁴ Take froin them even that they
have.'' Christ says, ‘⁶ Empty thyself of what thou hast;’'
Mammon says, “ Take also what they have⁵.'' Seest thou

(6) the opposition, seest thou the strife? Would ye that I shew
how a man cannot easily obey both, but must despise one?

Nay, does it need proos? How so? Do we not see 111 very

Perccive ye not how that the very words 010 painsul? How ‘

much more then the thing itself ἓ But it does not appear so
painsul in reality, because we are possessed with the disease.

Now if the sou] be but a little cleanscd of 1110 diseasc, as

long as it remains here, it ean judge right3 but when it

 

departs elsewhere, and is seized by 1110 sever, and is engaged
