lee Flood. lee land (ff Sodom a monument of real wrath. 419

there was no one who believed. But because they did not Hom.
believe the threat in words, they suffered the punishment in VIII
very deed. And this will be our fate too, if we shall not
have believed. On this account it is that He compares His
coming with the days of Noah, because as some disbelieved
in that deluge, so will they in the deluge of hell. Was that
a threat? was it not a fact? Then will not He, who then
brought punishment upon them so suddenly, much more
inflict it now? For the things that are committed now are
not less than the offences of that time. How?—because
then, it says, tlze sons os God went in unco tlze clazcylzlers osGen· 6,
men. And those mixtules weie the great offence. But now 4.
there is no form of wickedness, w hich is unattempted. Do
you then believe that tbe deluge took place? Or does it
seem to you a fable? And yet the mountains where the ark
rested, bear witness. I speak of those in Armenia.

But, even superabundantly, Ι will turn my discourse to (3)
another thing more evident than that. Has any one of you
ever travelled in Palestine? For I will no longer mention
report, but facts, and yet the other were clearer than facts.
For those things which the Scripture says, are more to be
trusted than things we see. Has any one of you then ever
travelled in Palestine? I suppose so. Bear witness then
for me, ye who have seen the places, to those who have not
been there. For above Ascalon and Gaza up to the very
end of the river Jordan there is a country wide and fruitsul—
or rather there w as——for it is not now. This then was as a
Paradise. For itis said, Lot beleeld all the plain ofJordcm— From

the Lord. This, therefoic, that was so flourishing, and that
rivalled all countries, which for thrivingness exceedesl the
Paradise of God, is now more desolate than any wilderness.
And there stand trees, indeed, and they bear fruit. But the
fruit is a monument of the wrath of God. For there stand
pomegranates, I speak both of the trees and the fruit,
having a very fine appearance, and to the ignorant holding
out great hopes. But if they are taken into the hand, being
broken open they display no fruit indeed, but much (lust and
ashes stored up within. Such also is the whole land. If
you find a stone, you will find it full of ashes¹. And why do ’μτένῖῑνφεω-
