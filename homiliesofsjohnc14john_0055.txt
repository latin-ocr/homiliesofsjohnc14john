For did you hold money and the glory of this world to be gabli,
nought‚ you would not cast an evil eye on its possessors.
But since you gape at these things, and idolize thern, and are (4)
fluttered by them, for this reason envy troubles you, and vain-
glory, it all springs from idolizing the things of the present life.
Art thou envious because another man is rich ? Nay, such an
one is an object for pity and for tears. But you laugh, and
answer straight, I am the object for tears, not he! Thou
art an object for tears, not because thou art poor, but because
thou thinkest thyself wretched. For we weep for those, who
have nothing the matter, and are discontented, not because
they have any thing the matter, but because, without having,
they think they have. For tell me, if any one, curecl of a sever,
still is restless and rolls about, lying in health on his bed,
is he not more to be wept for than those in fever, not that he
has a sever, for he has none, but because having 110 sickness
he still thinks he has? And thou art an object for tears just
because thou thinkest thyself so, not for thy poverty. For
thy poverty thou art to be thought happy.
Why enviestthou the rich man ? Isitbecause he has subjected
himself to many cares? to aharder slavery? because 110 is bound
by his own money, like a dog with ten thousand chains? Even-
ing overtakes him, night overtakes 111111, but the season of
rest is to him a time of trouble, of anguish, of pain, of care.
There is a noise: he straightway jumps up. Has his neigh-
bour been plundered? He who has lost nothing cares
more for it than the loscr. For that man has lost once, but
