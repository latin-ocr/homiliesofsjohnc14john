to bring him some contribution, for toward the end of the ῙῗῼζΜέ
Epistle he shews that he brought him money, when he says, ⁴ ‘
I-Icwz'ny received qf Epaplzrodt'tus the tlainqs which were sent Phil.4,
from you. 13‘
It is probable then, that on his arrival at the city of Rome,
he found Paul in such great and urgent peril, that those who
were accustomed to resort to him were unable safely to do
so, but were themselves in peril by their very attendance‚
which is wont to happen chiefly in very great dangerS, and
the exceeding wrath of kings, (for when any one has offended
the king, and is cast into prison, and is strictly guarded,
then even his servants are debarred from access, which
probably then befell Ρ3111,) and that Epaphroditus, being of
3 noble nature, despised all danger, that he might go in unto
him, and minister unto him, and do every thing which need
required. He therefore sets forth two facts, by which he
gains for him their respect 3 the one, that he was in jeopardy
well nigh unto death, he says, for my sake, the other, that
in so suffering he was representing· their city, so that the
recompence for that his peril would be accounted to those
who sent him, as if the city had sent him as their ambassador,
so that a kind reception of him and thanks for what he had
done may rather be called a participation in the things that
he had dared. And he said not, “ for my sake,'’ but obtains
the more credit for his words, by saying, becausejbr the work
of God, he acts not for my sake, but for God, he was niyh,
unio deam. What then? though by the providence of God
116 died not, yet he himself regarded not his life, and gave
himself up to any suffering that might befall him, so as not
to remit his attendance on me. And if he gave himself up
to death to serve Paul, much more would he have endured
this for the Gospel's sake. Or rather, this had been for the
Gospel's sake, even to have died for Paul. For we may bind
about our brows the crown of martyrdom, not only by
refusing to sacrifice, but such causes as these also make
death martyrdom, and if Ι may say something startling, these
latter do so far more than the former. For he who dares to
face death for the lesser cause, will much rather for the
greater. Let us therefore, when we see the Saints in danger,
regard not our life, sor it is impossible without daring ever
