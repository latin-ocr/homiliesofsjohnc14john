F οι· when indeed there is no love, we both upbraid men
with our kindncsses and we exaggerate little ones, but when
there is love, we both conceal them and wish to make the
great appear small, that we may not seem to have our friend
for a dehtor, but ourselves to be debtors to him, in having
him our clebtor. I know that the greater part do not under-
stand what is said, and the cause is, that I am speaking of a
thing which now dwells in heaven. As therefore if I were
speaking of any plant growing in India, of which no one had
ever had any experienee, no speech would avail to represent
it, though Ι should utter ten thousand words: so also now
whatever things I say, I say in vain, for no one will be able
to understand me. This is a plant that grows in heaven,
having for its branches not heavy-clustered pearls¹³‚ but a
virtuous life, much more acceptable than they. What plea-
sure would you spe-ak of, the foul, or the honourable‘? But
that of fn’endship excelleth them all, though you should
speak of the sweetness of honey. For that satiates, but a
friend never does, so long as he is a friend ; nay, the desire
of him rather increases, and such pleasure never admits of
satiety. And a friend is sweeter than the present life. Many
therefore after the death of their friends have not wished to
live any longer. With a friend one would bear even banish-
ment willingly3 but without a friend would not choose to
inhabit even his own country. With a friend even poverty
is tolerable, but without him both health and riches are

ι Am- intolerable. Such an one has another self3 I am straitened ¹,

''ffflfflbecause I cannot instance by an example. For I should

clhilissing, make it appear that what has been said is much less than it
ought to bc.

And these things indeed are so here. But from God the

reward of friendship is so great, that it cannot be expressed.

He gives a reward, that we may love one another. For He

says, ‘ Leve, and receive a reward,' for that, for which we

owe a reward. ‘ Pray,’ He says, ‘ and receive a reward,⁷

for that for which we owe a reward, because we ask for good

things. ⁴ For that which you ask,’ He says, ‘ receive a
