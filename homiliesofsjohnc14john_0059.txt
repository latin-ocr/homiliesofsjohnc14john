Wealth moves envy ,· the despised escape. 29

and the rich, and powerful‚ have ended their days more wreteh- Hom.

edly than evil doers, than bandits, than grave-robbers. For
what poverty brings in thy case, that doth wealth in theirs. For
that Which they who would ill-treat thee do through thy con-
temptible estate, they do to him from envy and the evil eye
they cast upon him, and the latter still more than the former.
This is the stronger craving to ill-treat another. He who
envies does every thing with all his might and main, while the
despiser ofttimes has even pity on the despised3 and his very
poverty, and utter want of power, has often been the cause of
his deliveranee.

And sometimes by saying to him ¹, ‘⁶ A great deed it will
be if you make away with such an one! If you slay one poor
man, what vast advantage will you reap !'' we may thus sosten
down his anger. But envy sets itself against the rich,and ceases
notuntil it has wrought its will, and has poured forth its venom.
See you, neither poverty nor wealth is good in itself, but our
own disposition. This then let us bring to a good tone, this let
us discipline in true wisdom. If this be well affected, riches
cannot east us out of the kingdom, poverty cannot make us
come short. But we shall meekly bear our poverty, and re-
ceive no loss in the enjoyment of future goods, nor even here
on earth. But we shall both enjoy what is good on earth,
and obtain the good things in heaven, which God grant
that we may all obtain, through the grace and lovingkind-
ness, διο.
