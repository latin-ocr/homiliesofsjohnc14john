332 Christ and His Anyels presen! at yodly Marriaqes.

the Prophet, saying, Serve tlte Lord with sear, and rcy‘oice
mtto Him with tremblinq? But ye are wholly without re-
straint& Is it not possible both to enjoy pleasure, and to do
so with safety? Art thou desirous of hearing beautiful songs?
Best of all indeed, thou oughtest n0t3 nevertheless, Ι con-
descendis thou wilt have it so: do not hear those Satanic
ones, but spiritual. Art thou desirous of seeing choirs of

’- dancers1? Behold the choir of Angels. And how is it

possible, saith one, to see them? If thou drive away all
these, even Christ will come to such a marriage, and Christ
being present, the choir of Angels is present also. If thou wilt,
He will even now work miracles, as He did then3 He will
make even now the water, wine ; and what is more wonderful,
much, He will convert this unstable and dissolving pleasure‚
this cold desire, and change it into spiritual. This is to
make of water, wine. Where pipers are, no where there is
Christ3 but even if He should have entered, He first casts
those forth b, and then He works His wonders. What can
be more disagreeable than this Satanic pomp? where every
thing is inarticulate2, every thing without signifieancy 3 and
if there be any thing articulate, again all is shameful, all is
noisome.

Nothing is more pleasurable than virtue, nothing sweeter
than orderliness, nothing more amiable than gravity. Let
any celebrate such a marriage as Ι speak of 3 and he shall
find the pleasure3 but what sort of marriages these are, take
heed. First seek a husband for the virgin, who will be truly
a husband, and a protector3 as though thou wert intending
to place a head upon a body; as though about to give not
a slave, but a daughter into his hands. Seek not money, nor
splendour of family, nor greatness of country3 all 'these

things are superfluous3 but piety of soul, gentleness, the
true understandingss, the sear of God, if thou wishcst thy

darling⁴ to live with pleasure. For if thou seek a wealthier
husband, not only wilt thou not benefit her, but thou wilt
even harm her, by making her a slave instead of free. For
tho pleasure she will reap from her golden trinkets will not
