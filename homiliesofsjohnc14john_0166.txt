more like ghosts¹ than men. Evil spirits encompassed us
about, the Prince of this world laughing, deriding, and as·
saulting us, the Only-Begotten Son of God camo, sent forth
the rays of His Preseuce, and straightway dispellcd the dark-
ness. Thc King, who is on His Father's throne, came to us,
having lost His Father's throne. And when Ι say having lest,
think not of any removal, for He filleth the heavens and the
earth, but this Ι say by reason of the cconomy3 He came
to His enemy, who hated Him, who turned himself away, who
could not endure to behold Him, who blasphemed Him every

day. He saw him lying on a dunghill, eaten with worms,
afflieted with sever and hunger, having every sort of disease 3

for both sever vexed him, which is evil desire 3 and infiamma-
tion lay heavy on him, this is pride 3 and gnawing hunger
had hold of him, which is covetousness; and putrifying sores
on every side, for this is fornication3 and blindness of eyes,
which is idolatry3 and dumbness, and madness, which is to
worship stocks and stones, and address thein3 and great
deformity, for wickedness is this, foul to behold, and a most
heavy disease. He saw us speaking more foolishly than
the mad, and calling stocks our God, and stones likewise3
He saw us in such great guilt, and did not reject us, was not
wroth, turned not away, hated us not, sor He was a Master,
and could not hate His own creation. What does he do? As
a most excellent physician, He prepareth medicines of great
price, and Himself tastes them first. For He Himself first
followed after virtue, and thus gave it to us. And He first
gave us the Washing, like some antidote, and thus we
vomited up all our guilt, and all things took their flight at
once, and our inflammation ceased, and our sever was
quenchcd, and our sores were dried up. For all the evils
which are from covetousness‚ and anger, and all the rest,
were dissipated by the spirit. Our eyes were opened, our
ears were opened, our tongue spake holy words: our soul re-
ceived strength, our body received such beauty and bloom,
as it is like that he who is born a son of God should have
from the grace of the spirit. Such glory as it is like that
the new-born son of a king should have, nurtured in purple.
Alas! How great nobility did He confer on us! Yet we
remain thankless to Him who so loved us.
