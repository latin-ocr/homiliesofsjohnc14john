to the uttermost.

Ye, he says, became followers os tlte Clam-cloes os God
wleicle, are in Jadaea. This is a great consolation. It is no
wonder, he says, that they should do these things to you,
inasmuch as they have done it also to their own countrymen.
And this too is no little proof that the Proclamation is true,
that even Jews were able to endure all things. For yse, he
says, have suffered like tlziuys osyour own countrymen, even
as they have from tlte Jews. There is something in his
saying, ‘ as they also in Judaea,’ for it shews, that every
where they rejoiced, as having contended. He says there-
fore, that με also leave scqffered like tlcinqs. And again,
what wonder is it, if they have dared to do to you, the like
things which they have done also to the- Lord?

Do you see how he introduces this as containing great

this for the sake os truth. There is therefore not only a con-
solation under the temptations, but they are reminded not to
think that [the Jews] did it for the truth's sake, and be troubled
on that account. And have persecuted ηεξ, 110 says. And
we also, he says, have suffered numberless evils. And tlzey
please not (ἶσα, and are contrary to all memforbiddinq us
to speak to tlte Gentiles, that tlzey miyht be saved. C'ontrary
to all men, he says. How? Because if we ought to speak to
the world, and they forbid us, they are the common enemies
of the world. They have slain Christ and the prophets, they
insult God, they are the common enemies of the world, they
banish us, when coming for their salvation. What wonder
