What? dost thou blush to tell? Dost thou blush, and yet {sff-
force them to do it? If it is honourable, wherefore dost thou ’
1101 do it thyself as well? but if disgracefiil, wherefore dost
thou compe] another? Every thing should be full of chaste-
ness, of gravity, of orderliness; but now I see the reverse,
people frisking like camels and mules. For the virgin, her
chambe1·¹‘ is the only befitting place. ‘ But,' saith one, ‘ she is
poor? Because she is poor, she ought to be modest also3 let
her have her character¹ in the place of a fortune. Has she1 τρόπον
no dowry to give with herself? Then why dost thou make
her otherwise contemptible¹ through her life and manners?
1 praise the custom, that virgins attend to do honour to their
fe110w3 that matrons attend to do honour to her who is made

 

one of their order. Rightly hath this been ordered. For
these are two companies, one of virgins, the other of the
married 3 the one are giving her up, the other receiving her.
The bride is between them, neither virgin, nor wife, for she
is coming forth from those, and entering into the fellowship
of these. But those harlots, what mean they? They ought to
hide their faces when marriage is celebrated3 they ought to
be dug into the earth, (for harlotry is the corruption of
marriage) but We introduce them at our marriages. And,
when ye are engaged in any work, ye count it ill-omened to
speak even a syllable of what is adverse to it; for instance,
when thou sowest, when thou drawest off the wine from thy
vats, thou wouldest not, even if asked‚ utter a syllable about
vinegarm3 but here, where the object is chasteness, introduce
ye the vinegar? for such is an harlot. When ye are preparing
sweet ointment, ye suffer nought ill—scented to be near. Mar-
riage is a sweet ointment. Why then introducest thou the
foul stench of the dunghill² into the preparation of thy oint-Qssnffla-
ment? What sayest thou? Shall a virgin (lance, and yetffl
feel no shanie before her fellow? For she ought to have inore
gravity than the other; she hath at least come forth froin the
[nurse’s] arm ³, and not from the palaestra. For a virgin ought ³ ἐξ 0¹27-
