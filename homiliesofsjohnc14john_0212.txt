which ye ltave heard, ancl which was preaclzecl to every
creature which is under heaven. For it had now been

‘gfff-‘an to Timothy was written aster this3 and when he was now
offnEddssome to the very end of his life, for there he says, for

that to the Philippians, for in that Epistle 110 appears to be
entering upon his imprisonment at Rome.
Jaema, But why (10 Ι sa)v that these Epistles have some advantage²
