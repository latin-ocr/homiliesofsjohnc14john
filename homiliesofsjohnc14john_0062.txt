:32 Christ, how ql‹»·<'fied‚ in St. l'mcl's lg'l'e οφ· death.

always, so now, Christ shall be maqmfied in my body. How
so ? Ofttimes have Ι fallen into dangcrs‚ when all men gave us
up, and what is more, when I myself did. For we laad tlze
sentence of death in owselves, but from all the Lord delivered
me, so now too He shall be magnified in my body. And
lest any one should suppose and say, If you die will He not
then be magnified? Yes, he answers, I know He will, for this

cause Ι said, not my life alone shall magnify Him, but
my death too. At present he means by lffe, They will

not destroy me, but even did they 30, Christ will even thus
be magnified. How so? Through life‚because He delivered me,
but through my death, because even death itself could not
persuade me to deny Him‚ since He gave me such readiness,
and made me stronger than death. On the one hand because
He freed me from peril; on the other, because He suffered me
not to sear the tyranny of death: thus shall He be magnified
through life and death. And this he says, not as though he
were about to die, but lest on his death they should be affected
as men arc apt to be.

But that you may know these his words did not point to
immediate death, the thought that pained them most, see how
he relieves it by almost saying, These things I say, not as one
about to die3 wherefore he soon after adds, And lzaviny this
confidenee I know that I shall continue with you all. The
words, iu nothiny I shall be ashamed‚ mean, that death brings
no shame to me, but rather great gain. How so? Because I
am not immortal, but Ι shall shine more brightly than if I
were so, for it is not the same thing for one immortal‚ and for
him who must die, to despise death3 so that not even instant
death is shame to me, yet shall I not die3 in nothing shall Ι
be ashamed‚ neither in life nor death. I will bear either
nobly, whether life or death. Well says he! This is the part
of a Christian soul! but he adds, in alc boldness. Seest thou
how entirely I am freed from shame? For if the sear of death

ιί- had cut short¹ his boldness, death would have been worthy of
, shame‚ but if death at its approach casts no terror on me, no

shame is here3 but whether I live, through life I will not be

, ashamed‚for I still preach the Gospel ², or whether I die‚through
an.- death I will not be ashamed‚ for sear hath not disgraced me, since

Ι still exhibit the same boldness. Do not, when l mention
