652 The ‘ Form of God’ implies Divine Persoualt'ly.

Pan„ are mere names given to one Person. Marcion·¹ of Pontus

2, 5-8.

 

says, that God the Creator of all things is not good, nor the
Fathcr of our Lord Jesus Christ, but that there is another
righteous 011e0‚and that the Son did not take fiesh for us.
Marcellus‘, and Photinusg, and Sophronius assert, that the
Word is an energy, instead of a substance, and that this energy
dwelt in Him who was of the seed of David, and not a personal
substance.

Arius consesses indeed the Son, but only in word3 sor he
says that He is a creature, and much inferior to the Father,
and others say that He has not a soul. Seest thou the cha·
riots standing? See then their fall, how he overthrows them
all together, and with a single stroke. How then does he
throw them down? Let the same mind be in =you, he says,
which was ‘in Christ Jesus, who beiny in the form qu'od‚
thouqlce it not ‘robbery to be equal with, God. By this Paul¹¹
of Samosata has fallen, and Marcellus, and Sabellius. For
he says, Beinq in the form of God. If in thesin-m, how
sayest thou, O wicked one, that He took His origin from
Mary, and was not before? and how again, that He was an
energy? For it is written, being] in the form of God, He took
the form qf a servant. Tell me, the form ofa servant, is it
the energy of a servant, or the nature of a servant? Thou
wilt say, “ Truly the nature of a servant.’' Thus too the form
of God, is the nature of God, and therefore not an energy.
Behold Marcellus of Galatia, sophronius and Photinus have
fallen.

Behold Sabellius too. It is written, He thoaqht z't not
robbery to be equal with God. Now equality is not predi-
cated, where there is but one person, for that which is equal
hath somewhat to which it is equal. Seest thou not the
substance of two Persons, and not empty names without
things? Hearest thou not the eternal pre-existence of the
Only-begotten? And thus much against these.

Lastly, What shall we say against Arius³, who asserts the
Son is osa different substance? Tell me now, what means,
He look the form of a servant? it means, He became Man.
