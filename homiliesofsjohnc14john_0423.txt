What then is this which I say, and for which Ι have made (4)
so long an exhortation? Because the garment indeed which
your slave wears, you would not choose ever to wear, being
disgusted on account of its filth, but you would rather go
naked than make use of it. But a body that is unclean and
filthy, and which is used not only by your slave, but by
numberless others, that will you abuse, and not be dis-
gusted? Are you ashamed at hearing this? But be ashamed
of the actions, not of the words. And I pass over all other
things, the rudeneSS, and the corruption of their manners,
the servility and illiberality of the rest of their life. Tell me,

not pierced with anguish?

I said indeed to your fathers, that they ought carly to lead

the flame of lust? For they, who have been able, are your
accuserS, in that they are partakers of the same nal ure.
Hear Paul saying, Follow peace . . . ancl lzolz'ness, without Heb.l2,
which no mem shall see the Lord. Is not this threat sufficient 14·
to terrify you? Do you see others continuing altogether in
chastity, and in gravity passing their lives3 and cannot you
command yourself even so long as the period of youth ? Do
you sec others ten thousand times overcoming pleasure, and
cannot you once refrain ? With your leave, I will tell you tho
cause. For youth is not the cause, since then all young men
would bc dissolute. But wc thrust ourselvcs into the fire.
For when you go up to the theatro, and feast your eyes with
