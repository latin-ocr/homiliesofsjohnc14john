Care qf children pairfid, but sweet to α parent. 501

Table with greater abundance, and you with less, but both Hom.
equally participate of the same. And if I take it first, it is IV.
no great privilege, since even among children, the elder first
extends his hand to the feast, but nevertheless no superior
advantage is gained thereby. But with us all things are
equal. The saving life that sustains our souls is given with
equal honour to both. I do not indeed partake of one
Lambk and you of another, but we all partake of the same.
We both have the same Baptism. We have been vouchsafed
the same Spirit. We are both hastening to the same king-
dom. We are alike brethren of Christ, we have all things in
common.

WVhere then is my advantage? In cares, in labours, in
anxieties, in grieving for you. But nothing is sweeter than
this grief, since even a mother grieving for her child is de-
lighted with her grief, she thinks caresully of those whom she
has brought forth, and is delighted at her cares. And yet
care in itself is bitter, but when it is for children, at least it
has in it much pleasure. Many of you have Ι begotten, but
after this are my pange. For iu the case of mothers in the
flesh the pangs are first, and then the birth, But here the
paugs last till the latest breath, lest there should be any
where some abortion even aster the birth. And I indeed have
a further longing¹3 for although perchance another has helima-0⁶15-
gotten you, yet Ι nevertheless am harassed with cares. For
we do not of ourselves beget you, but it is all of the grace
of God. But if we both through the spirit beget2, he2e ιιιιι εὶ
will not err who calls those begotten3 by me, his childrenstffn-rffl„
and those begotten by him, mine. All these things then
consider, and streteh forth your hand, that both you may be
our boast and we yours, in the day of the Lord J esus, which
God grant that we may all see with confidenee, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.
