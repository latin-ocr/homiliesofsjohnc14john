Virtue can be eaeercz‘sed in all circumstances. 145

virtuous man, who is devoted to God, manifests 1115 virtue, if Hrom.
you cast him into wealth, or if into poverty, ifinto disease, if 3³11.
into health, if into honour, if into dishonour. Did not the
Apostles pass through every state, By honour, it is written‚2 Cor.
and dishonour, by qood report and evil report? For this δ’δ’
makes the athlete, that he should be prepared for every
thing, for such is the nature of virtue.

If thou sayest, I am not able to preside over many, 1
ought to lead a solitary life3 thou offerest an insult to virtue,
for it can make use of every state, and shine through all:
only let it be in the soul. Is there a famine? 01· is there
abundance? It shews forth its own strength, as Paul saith,
I know how to almund, aud how lo szqffer need. W'as he Phil-4.
required to labour? He was not ashamed, but wrought two ἐξά, 28,
years. *vVas hunger to be undergone? He sank not under it, 30·
nor wavered. &Vas death to be borne? He became not
dejected, through all he exhibited his noble mind and skill.
Him therefore let us imitate, and we shall have no cause of
grief: for tell me, what will have power to grieve such an
one? Nothing. As long as no one deprives us os this
virtue, we shall be the most blessed of all 111611, 111 this lise
as well as in that to come. For suppose the good man bath
a wife and children, and riches, and great honour, with all
these things he romaineth alike virtuous. Take them away,
and again in like sort he will be virtuous, neither over-
whelmed by his missortunes‚ nor puffed up by prosperity,
but as a rock standeth equally unmoved in the raging sea
and in calm, neither broken by the waves nor influenced at
all by the calm, thus too the strong mind stands firm both iu
calm and in storm. And as little children, when sailing 111 a
ship, are tossed about, whilst the pilot sits by, laughing aud
undisturbed, and delighted to see their confusi0n3 thus too
the soul which is truly wise, when all others are in con-
fusion, or else are inopportunely smiling at any change 01
circumstance, itself sits unmoved, as it were, at the hehn of
piety. For tell me, what can disturb the pious soul? Can
death? This she knows to be the beginning of a better life.
Can poverty? This helps her on toward virtue. Can disease?
She regards not its presence. Why speak Ι of disease? She
regards neither ease, nor tribulati0n3 sor being besorehand
