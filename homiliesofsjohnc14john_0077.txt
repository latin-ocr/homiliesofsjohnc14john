my peace, and not mentioning aught, to remove them, it would
behove me to be silent. But if the contrary comes to pass3
for not only on our silence are these things not removed, but
rather become worse3 we are forced to speak. For he who
rebukes sinners, if he does nought else, suffers them not to
go farther. For there is no spirit so shameless and rash, as
not to turn, and remit the extravagance of its evil deeds, 011

insufficient to bring us to a right tone, He hath prepared
many other ways for avoiding sin. For example, the accu-
sations of men, sear of the enacted laws ¹², love of reputation,
the desire of forming fiiendships, all these are paths to avoid
sin. Ofttimes that which has not been done sor God's sake, has
