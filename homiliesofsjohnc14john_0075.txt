Well said he, terrg'fied, this is what befals us from our
enemies, they only terrify. Iu nothing] therefore, he says,
whatever happens, whether dangers—whether plots. For
this is the part of those who stand upright, the enemy
can do nought but terrify only. Since it was likely
that they should be affrighted, when Paul suffered such
numberless ills, he says, I exhort you not only not to be
shaken, but not to be terrified, yea rather to despise them
heartily, for if ye are thus affected, ye will straightway, by

salvation. For when they see, that with their innumerable
plots they are unable to terrify you, they wil] take it as a
proof of their own destruction. For when the persecutors
prevail not over the persecuted, the plotters over the objects
of their plots, the powerful over those subject to their power,
will it not be sels evident, that their perdition is at hand,
that their power is nought, that their part is false, that theire
part is weak? And this 116 says comes of God.

the gift of grace, a free gift. Be not then ashamed of the
gracious gift, soritis far more wonderful than the power of
raising the dead, or working miracles, as there I am a debtor
