By 110 means. This I must make clear to you by a kind of 111
example. Let us imagine some one in great wealth, with
many servants, and much gold, and who makes no use of all
these things, is such an one rich for all his wealth? By no
means Lethim see his children dissipating his property by dis-
orderly living, and 3 et tal e no care for it3 still further if you
will, when beaten let him 1101 be pained; shall we call him a
man of wealth? By no means; although his wealth is his
own. Thus too Paul says, To me to live is Christ ; if you
will enquire of my life, it 15 Ηο, and my death, it is gain.
Wherefore ? Because I shall more clearly be present with
Him; so that my death is rather a coming to life 3 they
who kill me will work on me 110 dreadful thing, they will
only send me onwards to my proper life, and free me from
that which is 1101 mine. that then, while thou wert here,
wert thou not Christ's? Yes, and in a high degree.

should say, If we gain no advantage here, wherefore (10 wc
not make away with ourselves, nor slay ourselves? By no
means, he answers. It is open to us to profit even here, if we
live not this, but another life, But perchance one will say,
does this bear thee fruit? Yes! he answers. lVliere are
