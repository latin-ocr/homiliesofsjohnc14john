420 Trees andfiuits qf'Sodom remain, but in ashes.

lTnzs.I speak of stone and wood and earth, where the air and

‘²’ ¹8· water partake of the calamity? For as when a body is bumt
and consumed, the shapo remains, and the outline in the
appearance of the fire, and the bulk and the proportion, but
the power is no more, so truly there you may sec earth,
which yet has nothing of earth about it, but all ashes; trees
and fruit, which have nothing of trees and fruit about them3
air and water, which have nothing of air or of water about
them, for even these are turned to ashes. And yet how

believedst the words of Christ, I should not be compelled to
bring forward facts to induce belief. But since you have
evaded them, you shall be persuaded henceforth, whether
willing or unwilling. For what have you to say concerning
Sodom ? Would you wish also to know the cause, for which
these things were then done? It was one sin, a grievous and
aceursed one certainly, yet but one. The men of that time
had a passion for boys, and on that account they suffered
this punishment. But now ten thousand sins equal and even
