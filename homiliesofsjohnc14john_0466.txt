μ -· but it becomes too great for our power. Wherefore, I beseech

you, let us do every thing that we may never become drowsy.
Do you not see that when sentinels have only given way
a little to slecp, they derive no advantage from their long
watcb, for by that little they bave ruined the whole, having
given perfect security to him who is prepared to steal. For
as we do not see thieves in the same way that they see us,
so also the devil most of all is ever instant, and lying in
wait, and grinding his teeth. Let us not then slumber. Let
us not say, on this side there is nothing, on that side nothing.
We are osten spoiled from a quarter whence we do not expect
it. So it is with vice. We perish from a quarter whence we
do not expect it. Let us look carefully round upon all
things, let us not be drunken, and we shall not sleep. Let
us not be luxurious, and we shall not slumber. Let us not
be mad for externa] things, and we shall continue in sobriety.
Let ns compose ourselves on every side. And as those who
walk upon a tight rope cannot be off their guard ever so
little, for that little causes the greatest mischief: for the man
losing his balance is at once precipitated down and perishes3
so neither is 11 possible for us to be remiss. We wall< upon
the narrow road intercepted by precipices on either side, not
admitting of two feet at the same time. Seest thou not how
much carefulness is necessary? Seest thou not how those
who travel on roads flanked by precipices guard not only
their feet, but their eyes also? For if he should choose to
gaze on one side, though his foot stand firm, his eye becoming

dizzy from the depth, plunges the whole body down, But
116 must take heed to himself and to his steps3 wherefore he

says, ‘ neither to the right hand, nor to the left? Great is
the depth of vice, steep the precipices, much darkness below,
the way narrow. Let us take hecd with sear. Let us walk
with trembling. No one, who is travelling such a road, is
dissolved in laughter nor heavy with drunkenness, but travels
such a road with sobriety and carefulness. No one travelling
such a road carries with him any superfluities; for he would
be contented even lightly equipped to be able to escape.

No one entangles his own feet, but leaves them disengaged,
and free to move.
