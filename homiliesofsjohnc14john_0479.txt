too grudgingly, thinkest thou hast restored the whole, and

art affected as if thou hadst given more. And yet thou
oughtest both to have restored these, and to have added
other out of thine own private possessions. For as 1116 thief

is not excused when he gives back only what he has stolen,

but often he has added even his life ; and often he 6011111011111151 ¹ διελό-
upon restoring many times as much: so also should the '‘m“
covetous man. For the covetous man also is a thies and a
robber, far worse than the other, by how much 116 18 also more
tyrannical. For he indeed by being concealed, and by making

his attack in the night, cuts off much of the audacity of 1116
attempt, as if he were ashamed, and feared to sin. But the
other having no sense of shame,with open face in the middle

of the market place steals the property of all, being at once a
thief and a tyrant. He does not break through walls, nor
extinguish the lamp, nor open a chest, nor tear off seals
But what? He does things more insolent than these, in the
sight of those who are injured he carries things out by the
door, he with confidence opens every thing, he compels them

to expose all their possessions themselves. Such is thc
excess of 1118 violence. This man is more wicked than those,
inasmuch as he is more shameless and tyrannical. For 116
that has suffered by fraud is indeed grieved, but he has no
small consolation, that he who injured him was afraid of him.
But he who together with the injury he suffers is also despised,

will not be able to endurc the violence. For the ridicule is
greater. Tell me, if one committed adultery with a woman in
secret, and another committed it in the sight of her husband,
who would grieve him the most, and be most apt to wound
him. Would not the latter? For he indeed, together with

the wrong he has done, treated him also with contempt. But

the former, if 116 (11(1 nothing else, shewed at least that he
feared him whom he injured. So also in the case of money.

He that takes it secretly, does him honour in this respect, that

he does it secretly; but he who robs publicly and openly,

together with the loss adds also shame.
