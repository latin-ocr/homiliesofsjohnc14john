· for sinuers, thus did he weep. For out of much affliction

amc anyuislz oslzoart I wrote mtto you in many tear& For
when 116 had no cause of grief on his own account, 116 did so
on account of others, or rather he accountcd those things too
to be his own, at least as sar as grief went. Others were
offended, and he burned3 others were weak‚ and he was
weak3 such grief as this is good, is superior to all worldly
joy. Him who so grieves I prefer to all 111611, 01 rather
the Lord Himself pronounces them blessed‚ who so grieve,
who are kindly affectioned 0116 toward another. I do
not so much admire him in dangers, or rather I do not
admire him less for the dangers by which he died daily, yet
this still more captivatos me. For it came of a soul devoted
to God, and full of affection: from the love which Christ
Himself seeketh : from a brotherly and a fatherly sympathy,
01· rather, of one greater than both these. Thus we should
be affected, thus weep 3 such tears as these are full of great
delight 3 such grief as this is the ground of joy.

And say not to me: that do they for whom I grieve
gain by my so doing? Though we no way profit them for
whom we grieve, at all events we shall profit ourselves. For
he who grieveth thus on account of others, much more will
so do for himself 3 he who thus weepeth for the sins of others,
will not pass by his own sins unwept, or rather, he will not
quickly sin. But this is dreadsul, that when we are ordered
so to grieve sor them that sin, we do not even exhibit any
repentance for our own sins, but when sinning relnain with-
out feeling, and have care for and take account of any
thing, rather than our own sins. For this cause we rejoice
with a worthless joy, which is the joy of the world, and
straightway quenched, and which bearelh griefs innumerable.
Let 118 then grieve with grief which is the mother of joy, and
let us not rejoice with joy which beareth grief. Let us shed
tears which are the sceds of great joy, and not laugh with
that laughtcr, which beareth tho gnashing of teeth sor us.
