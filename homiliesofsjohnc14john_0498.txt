Mmy t31auts have sat upon the giound—and 110 who was
never thought on, has worn a diadem. Do not these things
happen every day? Do not our affairs resemble a kind of
wheel? Read, is you will, both our own (books), and those
without‘: sor they also abound in such exainples. lf from
pride you despise ours; if you admire the works of philoso-
phers, go even to them. They will instruct thee, relating
ancient calamities, as will poets, and orators, and sophists,
and all historialis. From every side, if you will, you may
find exauiples.

But is you will none of these things, reflect upon our very
nature, of what it consists, and wherein it ends. Consider,
when you sleep, of what worth are you? Is not even a little
beast able to destroy thee? For osten a little animal falling
from the roof has deprived many persons of sight, or has been
the cause of some other danger. But what? art thou not
less thau all beasts? But what sayest thou? {that thou
excellest in reason? But behold, thou hast not reason: for

the irrational creatures3 and this is possessed by robbers and
murderers, and violators of the tombs. But art thou proud
of thine understanding. It is no proof of understanding to
be prond. By this then first thou deprivest thyself of becom-
ing intelligent. Let us bring down our high thoughts. Let
us be moderate, and lowly, and meek. For such even Christ
