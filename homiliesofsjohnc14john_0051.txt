wise rather eneouraged thern. If then they, who were near
the dangers, were not only nothing hurt, but received greater
confidence, much more should you be of good cheer. Had
he when in bonds taken it hardly, and held his peace, it
were probable that they would be affected in like sort. But
as he spoke more boldly when in bonds, he gave them more
confidence than if he had not been bound. And how did
his bonds turn to tlzefzcrtlzeranee of tlze G'ospel? So God in
His dispensation ordered, he means, that my bonds were not
hid, my bondsl which were in Christ, which werefor Christ.

says he, are of good courage through my bonds, much more
am I. If I am the cause of confidence to others, much more
to myself. Ami manye bretlzren in tlte Lord. As it was a
great thing to say, My bonds give confidence to them, he
therefore adds beforehand, in llze Lord. Do you see how,
when he was constrained to speak great things, he departs
not from moderation? are much more bold, he says, to speaks

Ver. 15. Some indeed preacle. Christ eren of every and

And what this means is worth enquiry. Since Paul was
under restraint, many of the unbelievers, willing to stir up
more vehemently the persecution from the Emperor, them-
selves also preached Christ, in order that the Emperor's wrath
might be increased at the spread of the Gospel, and all his
anger might sall on the head of Paul. From my bonds then
two lines of action have sprung. One party took great
courage thereat; the other, from hope to work my destruction,
set themselves to preach Christ3 some of them llzronsslae (ancy,
