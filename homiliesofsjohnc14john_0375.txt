Prayers ostlte Saiuls qood, but with qood practice. 345

therefore, let us neither despise the prayers of the Saints, HoM.
nor throw every thing upon them: that we may not, on the Ῑ·
one hand, be indolent and live carelessly3 nor on the other
deprive ourselves of a great advantage. But let us both
beseech them to pray and list up their hands for us, and let

us adhere to virtum that we may be able to obtain the bless-

ings promised to those who love Him by the grace and luving-
kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, &c.
