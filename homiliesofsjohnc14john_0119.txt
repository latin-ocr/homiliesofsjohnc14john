Man's real excellencies (md hopes. 89

one of those blinded by presumption¹ hast none of these, HOM-
thou doest well in entertaining notions either above the level¹ 5⁷11.
of mankind, or beneath the very irrational creatures. For „ZZZ
this is the nature of blind presumption and of audacity3 it is
either unduly elevated, or on the other hand it is equally
depressed, never observing a proper proportion. We are equal

to Angels in this respect, that we have a Kingdom pledged

to us, the choirz, unto which Christ is joined. He that is a

man may be scourged, yet does he not succumb. A inan
laughs at death, is a stranger to sear and trembling, he does

not covet the larger portion. So that they all who are not

like this are beneath the irrational animals. For when in the
things of the body thou wouldest have the advantage, but
hast no advantage in the things that concern the soul, how

art thou aught else than inferior to the irrational animals?

For bring forward one of the vicious and unthinking, of those

that are living in excess and to selfQ. The horse surpassesffiv'ffm·
him in warlike spirit, the boar in strength, the hare in swift- ⁹⁵3¹&-
ness, the peacock in grace, the swan in fineness of voice, the
elephant in size, the eagle in keenness of sight, all birds in
wealth. thence then dost thou derive thy title to rule the
irrational creatures? from reason? But thou hast it not? for
when thou ceasest to make a due use of it, thou dost on the
other hand degener-ate into something inferior to the1n3 for
when thou possessing reason art more irrational than they9

it had been better hadst thou never from the first become
capable of exercising reason. For it is not the same thing
after having received dominion to betray the trust, but to let
pass the season to receive it. That sovereign, who is below

the level of his guards, had better never have had on the
purple. And it is the very self-same thing in this case.
Knowing then that without virtue we are inferior to the very
irrational animals, let us exercise ourselves therein, that we
may become men, yea rather Angels‚ and that we may enjoy

the promised blessings, through the grace and lovingkindness

of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, &c.
