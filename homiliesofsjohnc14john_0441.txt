But these things indeed are what human reasoning demands. VII.
But when God creates, let all things give way. If these
things are so diffieult, nay, so excessively difficult, I am re-
minded of those mad persons, who are curious about the
incorporeal Generation of the Son. Things that take place
every day, that are within the grasp of our hands, and that
have been enquired into ten thousand times, no one has yet
been able to discover3 tell me, then, how is it they are curious
about that secret and ineffable Generation? Is not the mind
of such men wearied in treading that void¹? Has it novamq-
been whirled into ten thousand giddinesses? Is it notssmmoe'
dumb-founded2? And yet not even so are they instructed.2faxoev³1=
When they are able to say nothing about grapes and figs,⁹‘⁶7”“
they are curious about God ! For tell me, how is that
grape-stone resolved into leaves and stems? How before
this were they not in it, nor seen in it? But it is not the
grape-stone, you say, but all is from the earth. Then how is
it that without this the earth bears nothing of itself? But let
us not be void of understanding. What takes place is nei-
ther from the earth, nor from the grape-stone, but from Him
Who is Lord both of the earth and of its seeds. For this rea-
son He has caused the same thing to be made both without
them, and with them. In the first place, shewing His own From
power, when he said, Let tlte earth bring] forth tlze herb qflGlefl· 1,

Why then have these things been said by us? Not idly,
but that we may believe also in the Resurrection, and that,
when again wishing to apprehend something by our reason-
ings, we are not able, we may not be angry and take offence,
but discreetly withdrawing and checking our reasoning, we
may take refuge in the power and skilfulness of God. Know-
ing these things therefore, let us put a curb upon our reason-
ings. Let us not transgress our bounds, nor the measures
that have been assigned to our knowledge. For, ff any 1Cor.8,

I speak not concerning God only, but concerning every
thing. For what wouldest thou learn about the earth?
