Who shall speak Thy power. O Lord, because Thou suf-
feredst not Paul to be hidden, because Thou madest mani-
fest to the world such a man? All the Angels of God praised

Job 38, Thee with one accord, when Thou madest the stars, and
so too surely when Thou madest the sun, but not so much as
when Thou didst manifest Paul to us, and to the whole world.
By this, the earth was made more brilliant than the heaven,
for he is brighter than the sol-ar light, he hath shot forth
more brilliant rays, he hath shed abroad more joyous beams.
What fruit hath this man borne for us! not by making fat
our corn, not by nurturin g our poinegranates, but by producing
and perfecting the fruit os holiness, and when falling to
pieces, continually recovering it? And all this with reason:
for the sun itself can nothing profit fi'uits that are once de-
cayed, but Paul has called out of their sins those who had
manifold deeays. And it gives place to the night,but he had
mastery over the Devil. Nothing ever subdued him, nothing
lnastered him. It indeed, when it mounts the heavens, darts
down its rays, but he, as he rose from beneath, filled not
the mid space of heaven and earth with light, but at once
opened his mouth, and filled the Angels with exceeding Joy.
