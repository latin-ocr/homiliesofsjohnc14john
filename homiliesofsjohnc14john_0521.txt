HOMILY IV.

ἒ Tnssss, ii. 6—9.

And now ye know what witlelzoldetlc, tlzat ke miylzt be revealed
in lais time. For tlze mystery of iniquity doch already
work: only he wlco now lettetlz will let, until lze be taken
out os tlte way. And tlzen shall that Wiolced be rewaled,
whom the Lord shall consume willa tlze spirit of His mouth,
and shall destroy with tlze briylztness of His comino: Even
kim, whose coming} is aster tlze working} of Satan.

ΟΝΕ may first naturally inquire, what is that which with-
holdeth, and after that would knOW‚ why Paul expresses this
so obscurely. that then is it that withholdeth‚ that is,
hindereth him from being revealed? Some indeed say, the
grace of the spirit, but others the Roman empire, to whom Ι
most of all accede ¹⁸. VVherefore? Because if he meant to
say the Spirit, he would not have spoken obseurely, but
plainly, that even now the grace of the spirit, that is the
gffls, withhold him. And otherwise he ought now to have
come, if he was about to come when the gifts ceased3 for
they have long since ceased. But because he said this of the
Roman empire, he naturally glanced at it, and for the present
speaks covertly and darkly. For he did not wish to bring
upon himself superfluous enmities, and useless dangers.
For if he had said that after a little while the Roman
empire would be dissolve-d, they would now immediately

have even overwhelmed¹ him, as a pestilent person, and all1 Gr.
buried.
