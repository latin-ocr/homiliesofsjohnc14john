222 Autlcority divine, even in tlte unworthy.

Coma. but when he hath laid it down, either aster he is departed or
¹⁷²⁰· even here, then indeed, then he will suffer a soror punish-
ment.

Do not, I pray you, think that these things are spoken
froin us3 itis the Grace of God which worketh in the un-
worthy, not for our sakes, but for yours. Hear ye then what

{Viat- ¹9> Christ saith. If tlte house be wortley, let gesom· peace come
Lffifssffistcpon it. And how becometh it worthy? If they receive
⁸· yon, Hc saith. But {f they receive you not, nor hear your
words, . . . verilqs I say unio you, it shall be more tolerable
for tlte land of Sodom and Gomorralt in tlte day oszcdy-
ment, tlcanfor that city. What boots it then, that yc receive
us, and hear not the things we say? What gain is it that ye
Ἀεςα- wait upon¹ us, and give no heed to the things which are
mam. spoken to you? This will be honour to us, this an admirable
service, profitable both to you and to US, if ye hear us.

1¹3nzegozst'sssseived by succession³; from it we speak; since the time
5⁴⁸9& that Christ hath vested ⁴ in us the ministry of reconciliation.
μηθ’ Ambassadors, whatever be their sort, because of the

they go into the heart of the land of barbarians alone,
through the midst of so many encmies3 and because the law
of embassy is of mighty power, all honour them3 all look
towards them with respect, all send them forth with safety.
And wc now have received a word of enibassy, and we are
come from God, sor this is the dignity of the Episeopate.
.·, άξωῡν. We are come to you on an embassy, requesting⁵ you to put
Μ’ an end to the war, and we say on what terms, not promising
to give cities, nor so and so many nleasures os corn, nor
slaves, nor gold3 but the kingdom of heaven, eternal life,
