this, the former indeed hath straightway lost the grateful
return3 but the other hath God sor his Debtor; and is
filled with good hopes, being every day feasted from off
that table. For the meats indeed are spent, but the grateful
thought is never spent, but every day he rejoices and
exults more than they that are gorged with their excess of
wine. For nothing doth so nourish the soul as a virtuous
hope, and the expectation os good things.

But now let us consider what follows. There indeed are
flutes, and hai-ps, and pipes3 but here is no music of sounds

indeed the Demons are hymned ; but herc, the Lord of all,
God. Seest thou with what gratitude this one aboundeth,
with what ingratitude and insensibility that? For, tell me,
when God hath sed thee with His good things, and when thou

any thing or not, fawn upon those they know, but thou dost
not even this. The dog, although he receives nothing, fawns
upon his master3 but thou, even when thou hast received,
barkest at Him. Again, the dog, even though he be well
treated by a stranger, not even so will be reconciled of his
hatred of him, nor be enticed on to be friends with him:
but thou, even though suffering mischief incalculable from
the Demons, introducest them at thy feasts. So that, in two
ways, thou art worse than the dog. And the mention Ι have
now made of dogs is happy, in regard of those who give
thanks then only when they receive a benefit. Take shame,
I pray you, at the dogs, which when famishing still fawn
upon their masters. But thou, if thou hast haply heard that
the Demon has cured any one, straightway forsakest thy
Master3 O more unreasoning than the dogs !

But, saith one, the harlots are a pleasure to look upon. that

not? Thy house has become a brothel, madness, and sury³;
