hope ofylorgss W hom we preaeh, bringing Him from above.
W'hom we, not Angels: tecte-hino and warniuq: not im-
periously nor using constraint, sor this too is of God's loving—
kindness to men, that they are not brought to Him after the
manner of a tyrant. Seeing it was a great thing he had
said, teoehiny, he added, warniny, which is rather like a
father than an instructor. Wtom, saith he, we preach, warn-
inq every man, and teaehiny every man in all wisdom ; that
is, with all wisdom and understanding, or saying all things
in wisdom. So that there is need of all wisdom, for the
ability to leam such things'exists not in every one. That we
may present every man perfect in Christ J esus. What sayest
thou, every man? Yea3 this is what we are earnestly de-

much watching. If Ι, for your good, thus watch, much
more ought ye. Then again, shewing that it is of God, he
saith, accordiny to His working] which work-eth in me
miqhtily. He shews that it is the work of God. He,
now, that makes me strong for this, evidently wills it. Where-
fore also when beginning he saith, By the will of God. So
that it is not only out of modesty he so expresses himself,
but insisting on the truth of the VVord as well. And Strivirzy.
In saying this, he shews that many are fighting against him.
Then great is his tender affection.

Then lest this should seem owing to their peculial· weak-
ness, he joined others also with them3 and as yet condemned
them not3 and as many as have not seen mysace in the flesh.
