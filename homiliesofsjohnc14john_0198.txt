wisdom or of virtue to almund! There is great need of
virtue, not less than in any other case. For as want inclines
us to do many evil things, so too doth plenty. For many
ofttimes, coming into plenty, have become indolent, and have
not known how to bear their good fortune. Many men have
taken it as an occasion of no longer working. But Paul did
not 8ο, for what he received he consumed on others, and
emptied himself for them. This is to know how to make
good use of what we have. He was in no wise relaxed, nor
did he exult at his abundance, Paul was the same in want
and in plenty, he was neither oppressed on the one hand,
nor rendered a boaster on the other. I know how hom to
be full, and to be Izunqry, bom to abozmd, ancl to szqffer need.
Many know not how to be full, as the Israelites, for they ale,
aud leit-hed, but 1 am equally well ordered in all. He
sheweth that he neither is now elated, nor was before grieved:
or if he grieved, it was on their account, not on his own, for
he himself was similarly affected.

Erery where, saith he, ancl in all things-9 I am 1ι’)ιεςίνιισΐιείῖ,
i. e. Ihave had experience of all things 111 this long time,
and all these things have succeeded with me. But since
boasting might seem to have a place here, he quickly cor-
recteth himself, and saith, J cau do all things-s* throuylt Cleri-st
which> strengslltenellt me. The success is not mine own, but
His who gave me strength. But since again they who confer
benefits, when they see the receiver not well affected toward
them, but despising the gifts, are themselves rendered more
remiss, (for they considered themselves as conferring a
benefit and refreshment‚) lest this should happen here, and
any one should say that, since Paul despises the resreshment,
they must necessarily become remiss, 800 how he healeth
this too. By what he hath said above, he hath brought down
their proud thoughts, by what followeth he maketh their
readiness revive, by saying, Notwitltstcmclinq ’με have well
done, ΙΙιαι pse dict communicale with my affliclion. Seest
thou, how he removed himself, and again united himself to
them. This is the part of true aud spiritual friendship.
Think not, saith 110, because Ι was not in want, that I had
no need of this act os yours. I have need of it for your sake.
How then, did they share his afflictions? By 11118 means.
