The Preacher qai-ns less than those who honour him. 315

Thou hast not gained reputation by speaking ; but by sharing ΗΘΜ,
in his joy thou hast gained more renown than he. For if love XI·
be a great thing, and the sum of all, thou hast received the
crown this gives3 he, that for oratory, thou, that for exceeding
love3 he displayed force of words, but thou by deeds hast cast
down envy, hast trodden under foot the evil eye. So that in
reason thou oughtest rather to be crowned than he, thy contest

is the more brilliant3 thou hast not only trodden under soot
envy, but thou hast even done somewhat else. He hath one
crown only, but thou two, and those both brighter than his one.
What are these ? One, that which thou wonnest against envy,
another, which thou art encircled with by love. For the
sharing in his joy is a proof not only of thy being free from
envy, but also of being rooted in love. Him ofttimes some
human passion sorely disquieteth¹, vainglory for instance313m0-
but thou art free from every passion, for it is not of vain· 76²⁰*-
glory that thou rejoicest at another's good. Hath he righted
the Church, tell me? hath he increased the congregation?
Praise him 3 again thou hast a twofold crown3 thou hast struck
down envy3 thou hast enwreathed thee with love. Yea, I
implore and beseech thee. Wilt thou hear of a third crown
even? Him, men below applaud, thee, the Angels above.
For it is not the same thing, to make a display of eloquence,
and to rule the passions. This praise is for a season, that for
ever3 this, of men, that, of God3 this man is crowned
openly: but thou art crowned in secret, where thy Father
seeth. If it were possible to have peeled off the body and
seen the soul of each, I would have shewn thee that this
is more dignified than the other, more resplendent.

Tread we under foot the goads of envy3 hereby we advan-
tage ourselves, beloved, ourselves shall we enwreath with
the crown. He that envieth another fighteth with God, not
with him3 for when he seeth him to have grace, and is grieved,
and wisheth the Chnrch pulled down, he fighteth not with
him, but with God. For tell me, if one should adorn a king's
daughter, and by his adorning and gracing her, gain for
himself renown3 and another person should wish her to be
ill attired ¹¹¹, and him to be unable to adorn her3 against whom 2 ·
