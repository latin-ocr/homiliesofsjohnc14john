Here he shews his great love, seeing that for this purpose
he sent him, and this was the cause of his journey3 and so

Eph. 6,

when we could 210 lonyer sorbear, ue thouyht it yood to be
left at Athens alone, aud seut Timotheus our brother. And
to the Ephesians he sends this very same person, and for the
very same cause, That he miyht know your estate, and
comfort your hearts. See what he saith, not ‘ that ye might
know my estate,’ but ‘ that Ι might know yours.’ So in no
place doth he mention what is his own. He shews that they

Ver. 9. With Onesimus, the belovecl aud faithful brother,
who is oue ofyou. They shall make kuowu unto you all

Onesimus is he about whom, writing to Philemon, he said,

that are done here.

Nothing can surpass this praise. This 18 116 11161 was
brought up from Jerusalem with him. This man ‘⁴' hath said
a greater thing than the prophets; for they call themselves
stranyers audforeiyners, but this one calleth himself even a
captive ¹². For just like a captive he was dragged up and
down ⁰, and lay at every onc's will to suffer evil of them, yea
rather worse even than captives. For those indeed their
enemies‚ after taking them, treat with much attention, having
a care for them as their own property: but Paul, as though

a Sav. adds, οὐκ, 11111 without neces· Β ἤγετο καὶ ἐφέρετο, which is most
