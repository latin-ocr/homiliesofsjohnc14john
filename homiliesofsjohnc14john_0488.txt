this? Are not these things deserving of much groaning?
They are indeed trissing, and are considered trifling, but they
engender great 51115 111 0111· characters. For when any obscene
and sweet melody is uttered, it 50110115 the mind, and corrupts
that soul itself too. And the poor man indeed who calls upon
