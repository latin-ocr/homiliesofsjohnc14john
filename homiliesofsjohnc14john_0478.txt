and children, and grandchildren, many do not regard many,
much more would it then be the case. On this account
God hath given thee children. Do not therefore accuse the
children.

But if they who have children have no excuse, what
ean they say sor themselves, who having no children vex
themselves about the acquisition of riches. But they have
a saying for themselves, which is destitute of all excuse.
And what is this? That, instead of children, they say‚we may

all too must needs be opened against thee. Dost thou see
that it is better to have nothing than to sustain such an
accusation ?

And these things indeed here. But what shall we do
There? tell me, having had so much at our disposal here,
if we have imparted to no one of our possessions, or at least
very little; how shall we put off our dishonest gains? For
he that wishes to put off his dishonest gains, does not give a
little out of a great deal, but many times more than he has
