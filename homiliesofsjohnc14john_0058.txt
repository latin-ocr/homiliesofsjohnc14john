Pfflh· You may have your will, and no one can hindei· you. De-
1'19' spise the world’s wealth‚ think it nought‚ as it is nought.
Cast out the desire of wealth‚ and you are straightway rich.
He is rich who desires not to become rich 3 he who is unwilling
to be poor, is the poor man. As he too is the diseased man k,
