Not for thc sake os the sorrows os the poor ‹lo I say these
things, but for your salvation 3 for they will perish that have
not fed Christ. For what, if thou dost seed some poor man?
still so long as thou livest so voluptuously¹ and luxuriously,
all is to no purpose. For what is required is, not the giving
much, but not too little for the property thou hast3 for this
is but playing at it.

Mortzfy therefore ,ιχοιιν member-5, he saith, which are upon
tlte earth. What say est thou? Was it not thou that saidst,
Ye are bmied; ye me buried toqetleer willa Ham,- ye are
6ἱι6ιιιηοὶ366ἰῑ ye have put offthe bodJ oftlte sins oftlzefleslz;
how then again sayest thou, lllortifst? Art thou sporting2?
Dost thou thus discourse, as though those things were in us?
There is no contradiction ; but like as if one, who has clean
scoured a statue that was filthy, or rather who has recast it,
and displayed it bright asresh, should say that the rust was

2⁷³- eaten⁴ off and destroyed, and yet should again recommend

diligence in clearing away the rust, he doth not contradict
himself, for it is not that rust which he scoured off that he
recommends should be cleared away, but that which grows
afterwards, so it is not that former putting to death⁵ he
speaks of, nor those fornicationS, but those which do after-
wards grow.

But lo! say the heretics‘, Paul accuseth the creation3 for
he said before, Set yom· affection on Μίνῳ above, not
on tleinqs on eartlm again he saith, Illortzjfy your mem-
bers which are upon the earth. But the words upon earth,
are here expressive of sin, not an accusing of creation.
For it is thus he calls sins themselves, things upon earth,
either from their being wrought by earthly thoughts and
upon earth, or from their shewiug sinners to be earthly.

For-mention, mecleauuess, he saith. He has passed over
the actions which it is not beooming even to mention, and
by uncleanness has expressed all together.

Inordz'nate (qffectz'on, he saith, evil concupisc-enee.
