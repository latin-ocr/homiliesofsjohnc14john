will no longer be able to bear it, but in this case it is not so3
for we spend not to waste our wholesome thoughts when it is
necessary for us to bear aught we would not choose, but
they abide with us continually. And mark the wisdom of
this blessed man. He said not, Let tlte word of Christ be
in you, simply, but what ? dwell in you, and ric-Idy.

Virtue he calls wisdom, reasonably, for lowliness of mind,
and almsgiving, and other such like things, are wisdom, just
as the contraries are folly, sor cruelty too cometh of folly.
WVhence in many places It calleth the whole of sin folly.
Tleefool, saith one, ΙιαίΙι said z‘n his beart, There is νο God;
and again, llsy wozmds stinlc and are corrupt from the face
ofmy foolz'slmess. For what is more foolish, tell me, than
one who wrappeth himself indeed about in garments, but
regardeth not his own brethren that are naked 3 who feedeth
dogs, and careth not that the image of God is famishing;
who is persuaded generally¹ that human things are nought‚
and yet is wedded to them as if 111111101101. Α5 111011 nothing
is more foolish than such an one, so is nothing wiser than
one that achieveth virtue. For mark3 doth any say, how

is loving to men2, he hath well considered that he beareth a
common nature with them ; he 110111 well considered the use
of wealth, that it is worthy of no estimation 3 that one ought
to be sparing of bodies that are of kin to one, rather than of
wealth. Wherefore he is 0 despiser of glory, and a philo-
sopher, for he knoweth human affairs3 and the knowledge of
things divine and human, is philosophy. So then 110 knoweth
what things are divine, and what are human, and from the
one he keeps himself, on the other he bestoweth his pains.

And tarry not for another to teach thee, sor thou hast the
