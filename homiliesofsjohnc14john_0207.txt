Mis-eries of Royalty. 177

saw his wife destroyed by medicines ¹, sor when she bore not, Hom.
a wretched and miserable woman (for such indeed she was 1332-
who thought to give the gift of God by her own wisdom) *ww
gave her medicines, and destroyed the queen, and herself
perished with her. Another again, after this ¹⁵, was destroyed

by noxious drugs, and his cup was to him no longer drink,

but death. And 1115 5011 100 had an eye put out, from sear

of what was to follow, though he had done no wrong. It is

not befitting to mention how another ended 1115 life miserably.

And after them, one was burnt, like some miserable wretch,
amongst horses, and beams, and all sorts of things, and

left his wife in widowhood. For it is not possible to
relate the woes which he was compelled to undergo in his
lifetime, when he rose up 111 revolt. And hath not he who

now 111165, from the time 116 received the crown, been 111 1011,

111 danger, in grief, in dejection, in misfortune, exposed to
conspiracies? Such is not the kingdom of heaven, but after

it is received, there is peace, life, joy, dclight. But as I
said, life cannot be without pain. For if in the affairs of

this world, 116 who is accounted most happy, if the king 15
burdened with so many missortunes, what thinkest thou
must be true of private life? Ι 63111101 say how many other
evils there are ! How many 5101165 have ofttimes been formed

on these subjects! For nearly all the tragedies of the stage,

as well as stories, have kings for their subjects. For most of
these stories are formed from true incidents, for it is thus they
please. As for example, Thyestes' banquet, and the destruc-

tion of all that family by their misfortunes.

These things we know from the writersl that are without: (6)

but if ye will, Ι will adduce instances from the Scripturc t00.

Saul was the first king, and ye know how he pelished, after
experiencing numberless ills. After him, David, Solonion,
Abia, Hezekiah, Josiah, in like sort. For it is not possible,
without affliction and toil, and without dejectior] of mind, to

pass through the present life. But let us be cast down in
mind, not for such things as 111656, for which kings grieve,

but for those things, whence we (thus) have great gain. For? Cor.
