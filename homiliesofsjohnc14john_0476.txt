4 16 Desire (ffriclws shown to be inemensalzle.

IIow long shall we love riches? For I shall not ceasc
exclaiming against them: for they are 1110 031150 of all evils.
How long shall wc sail 10 5311310 this inordinate desire?
that is the good os gold? Ι 3111 astonished at 1110 thing!
Truly there is some cnchantment in the business, that gold
and silver should be so highly valucd among us. For our
own souls indeed we have no regard, but those lifeless images
01131055 11111011 attention. VVhence is it that this disease has
invaded the world? Who shall bc able 10 effect its destruc-
tion? that reason ean eut off this evil beast, and destroy
it with utter destruction? The desire is deep sown in the
minds of 111011, even of 111050 who 500111 10 110 1011310115. Let
us be put to shame by 1110 00111111311(15 of the Gospel. WVords
only lie there in Scripturc, they are no where shewn by works.

And what is the specious plea of 1110 many? I have
children, one says, and I am afraid lest Ι myself be reduced
to the extremity of hunger and want, lest I should stand 111
need of others. I am ashamed to beg. For that reason there-

hunger. F or that reason then do you expose others to hunger?
Do you know what a dreadful 1111113 itis to beg, how dreadful
10 110 110115111113 by hunger? Spare also your brethren ! Are
you ashamed, tell me, 10 110 hungry, and are you not ashamed
to rob? Are you afraid to perish by hunger, and not afraid
10 destroy others ? And yet 10 be hungry is neither a (11531300
nor a crime ; but to cast others into such 3 51310 11111135 1101

All these are pretenees, words, trifles. For that it 15 1101
on account of your children that you 301 111115, they testify
who indeed have no children, nor will have, but who yet
labour and harass themselves, and are busy in aequiring
wealth, 35 11111011 35 if they had never so many¹ children to
leave it 10. 11 is not the care for his children that makes a
man 0ον010115, but a disease of 1110 50111. 011 11115 account
many even who have not children are mad for riches, and
others living with a great number of children even despise
what they have. They will accuse 11100 111 11131 Day. For if
the necessities os children compelled men to accumulate
1101105, they also must have had the same desire, the same
covetousness. And if they have not, it is not from the
