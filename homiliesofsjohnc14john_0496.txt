the sight of an improper object, that is the first impulse.

But if we should say, the beginning of chastity 15 fasting, that

by it. For that, whatever good things we do, this viee suffers

what things the Pharisee did, but they profited him nothing.

For he did not extirpate the root, but· it corrupted all his
