HOMILY IV.

Cot. i. ⁶21, 92.

And you, that were sometimes enemies and alienate& in
selom· mind by wielfed η’·ονᾸπς, yet now bath He reconcz'led
in the body (ψ’ Hisfleslt ἰὴν-011911 death, lo present you hely,
(md mzblameable, and uno-eproveable in Hats- sigslet.

HERE he goes 011 to shew that He reconeiled those even
who were unworthy of reconciliation. For the saying that
they were under the power of darkness, shews the calamity
in which they were. But lest, on hearing of tlze power es
darkness, thou shouldest consider it Necessity, he adds, Ami
you tlzat were alienated, so that though it appear to be the
same thing that he says, yet it is not so; for it is not the
same thing to deliver out of the evils him that through ne-
cessity came to suffer, and him that of his own will endures.
For the former indeed is worthy to be pitied, but the latter
hated. But nevertheless, he saith, you that not against your
wills, nor from eolnpulsion, but with your wills, and wishes,
sprang away from Him, and are unworthy of it, He hath
reconciledb. And seeing he had made mention of the tlzinqs
in heaven, he shews, that all the enmity had its origin from
hence, not thence. For they indeed were long ago desirous,
and God also, but ye were not willing.

ἢ The order of the words, ‘ enemies' the common order.
and ‘ alienated,’ is here inverted as b Edd.have ἀπήλλαξε, but the Trans-
compared with the Rec. text, and the lator conjectures ἀτοιιατῆλλαξι, which
Commentary that follows here, requires is confirmed by a Ms. in Brit. M.
