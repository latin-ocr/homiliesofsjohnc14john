approaches, what will be our feelings? And why do I speak
of those who are led away? A crowd then stands around, the
greater part not even knowing them. If any one looked into
their souls, no one is so cruel, no one so hard-hearted, no one so
firm, as not to have his soul dejected‚ and relaxed with fear
and despair. And if when others are taken off by this
death, which differs nothing from sleep, those who are not

greater evils, what then will be our state ? It is not, believe

Nay, you say, but God is merciful, and none of these things
will happen ! Then it is written in vain ! No, you say, but
only as a threat, that we may become wise ἱ If then we are not

How then ean we banish it? thatever things we say

have had an end. You have all heard of the deluge. And were
those things also said by way of threat? Did they not actually
happen? 'l'hosc 111011 100 831(1 many such things, and for
