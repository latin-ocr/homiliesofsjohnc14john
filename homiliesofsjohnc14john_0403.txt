How to be above ric-hes. What are tlte best stores. 37 3

thou wilt overcome the assault of the devil. Itis in thy power ΙῗΙὲΙΜ·

to acquire great gain. ’
Let us despise wealth, that we may not despise the soul.

But how can any one despise it? Dost thou not see in the

case of beautiful bodies, and the lovers of them, how as long

as they are in their sight the fire is kindled, the flame rises

bright 3 but when any one has removed them afar off, all is

extinguished, all is lulled to sleep, so also in the case of

wealth, let no one provide gold, nor precious stones, nor

necklaces3 when seen, they ensnare the eyes. But if thou

wouldest be rich like the ancients, be rich not in gold, but in

necessary things, that thou mayest bestow on others from

that which thou hast ready. Be not fond of ornament. Such

wealth is both easy to be assailed by robbers, and a thing

that brings us cares. Do not acquire vessels of gold and silver,

but let there be stores os bread and wine and oil, not that

being sold again they may procure money, but that they
may be supplied to those who need. If we withdraw ourselves

from those superfluities, we shall obtain heavenly goods3
which God grant that we may all obtain, in J esus Christ our
Lord, with Whom, &c.
