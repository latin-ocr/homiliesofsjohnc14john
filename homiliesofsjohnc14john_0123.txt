As then, when he calls these gifts, he does not put us out Hom.
of the pale of free will, but accords this to 113, 30 when he VIII.
says, ⁴ to work in us to will,⁷ 110 (1003 1101 deprive us of free (ρ’)
will, but 110 31101113 that by actually doing right we greatly
increase our heartiness in willing. For as doing comes
of doing, so of not doing comes not doing. Hast thou given
an alms? Thou art the more incited to give; but hast thou
