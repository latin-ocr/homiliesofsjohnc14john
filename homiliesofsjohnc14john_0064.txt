:34 How Sainls live nol this present [ψ’.

PfflL· he says, Ino lon-(ser lice. And here again, to me {0 live is
1,21. Christ. The word lise is much significant, beloved, i. e. it
sheweth many things, as also the word death. There is this
life of the body, and there is the life of sin, as he himself
elsewhere says, But lfwe are dead to sin, how shall we (my
lonqer live tleerez'n.. It is then possible to live the life of sin.
Attend diligently, 1 entreat you, lest my labourbe vain. There
Phil. 3, is a life eternal, immortal, heavenly, aster this. For om· con-
20. versation z's in heaven. There is the life of the body whereof
Acts 17,he speaks, throuqh him ‘we lire ancl move (md have om· beiwq.
28. He does not then deny that he lives the natural life, but that
of sin, which all men live; and rightly so, for how does he
live this life, who desires not the present lise? He who is hast-
ening to another, how does he live this life? He who
despises death, how does he live this life? He who desires
nought of the things here, how does he live it? For as one
made of adamant, though he were struck a thousand blows‚
would never attend to it, no more would Paul. And I live,
says he, but no lonyer I, that is, the old 1nan3 as again else-
Rom.7‚ where, [Vrelched amm that J am, who shall delicer me

nought for the sake of food, nought for the sake of clothing,
nought for any of these present things? Such an one does
not even live the natural life: he who takes thought for none
of the things which sustain life, lives not. We live this life,
whose every action regards it. But he lived not, for he
busied himself about nought of the things here. How then
lived he? Just as we are accustomed to say, in common
matters, such an one is not with me, when he does nothing
with reference to me. Again, in like sort such a inan lives
not for me. Elsewhere he shews that he rejects not the
Gal. 2, natural lise3 lee lg‘se which I now lise in lheflesh, I live
20. by ihefaz'th ofthe Son of God, ltho loz-ed me, (md yace Hem-
segffor me ; i. e. A certain new life I live, an altered one.
And truly all these things he said to comfort the Philippians.
Think not, says he, that I shall be deprived os this life, for
neither whilst alive did I live this life, but that which Christ
willed. For tell me? He who despises money, luxury,
hunger, thirst, dangers, health, safety, does he live this life?
He who has nothing here, and is osttimes willing to cast it
