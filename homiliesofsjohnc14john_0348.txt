Epaphras, wlio is oue of you, a servant of Christ, salutetli

stand perfect and complete in all tlze will of Goa'. For
I bear kim record, tlzat lie kam a qreat zealsor you, and
them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.

IN the commencement of this Epistle also, he commended
this man for his love3 for even to praise is a sign of love;
thus in the beginning he said, leo also (leclared anto us
your love in the Spirit. To pray for one is also a sign
of love, and causeth love again. He commends him more-
over in order to open a door to his teaching, for reverendness
in the teacher is the disciples' advantage3 and so again is his
saying¹¹, one of you, in order that they might pride them-
selves upon him, as producing such men. And he saith,
always striviny for you in prayers. He said not simply
‘ praying‚’ but strivinyu trembling and fearing. For I bear
lzae'm witness, he saith, tlzat lie lzatlz a zeal sor you. A trust-
worthy witness. leat lie bath, he saith, a yreat zealfor you,
that is, that he loveth you exceedingly3 and burneth with
passionate affection for you. And them tlzat are in Laodicea,
and tlzem in Hierapolis. He commendeth him to those also.

Epistle was read. For he saith, Oause tlzat it be read also in

² One Ms.‘ and so he adds, who isone qs yon! Ed. Par. conj. τῷ for rb,
