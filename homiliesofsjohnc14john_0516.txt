For as in the case of husbandmen, tho seeds indeed are
cast into the earth once for all, but do not eonstantly romain,
but require much preparation withal, and if they do not
break up tho earth, and cover over the seeds sown, they sow
for the birds that gather grain3 so we also, unless by constant
remembrance we bostow care upon what has been sown, have
but cast it all into the air. For both the devil carries it
away, and our sloth destroys it, and the sun dries it up, and
the rain washes it away, and the thorns choke it: so that it
is not sufficient aster once sowing it to depart, but there is
need of much attention and assiduity for him who would
gather the fruit, driving off the birds, rooting up the thorus,
filling up the stony ground with much earth, checking, and
sencing off, and taking away every thing injurious. But in the
case of the earth all depends upon the liusbandman, for it is a
lifeless subject, and prepared only to be passive. But in the
spiritual soil it is quite otherwise. All is not the teachers'
part, but half at least, if not more, that of the disciples. It
is our part indeed to cast the seed, but yours to do the
things prescribod, to shew the fruit iu your memory by
worksâ€š to pull up the thorns by the roots.

For wealth truly is a thorn, bearing no fruit, both uncomely
to the sight, and unpleasant sor use, inj urin g those that meddle
with it, not only not itself bearing fruit, but even hindering that
which was shooting forth. Such is wealth, lt not only does
not bear eterna] fruit, bnt it even hinders those. who are
willing to gain it. Thorns are the food of irrational camels3
they are devoured and consumed by fire, being useful for
nothing, but to kindle the furnaee, to light up that Day that
burns as an oven, to nourish passions void of reason, revenge
and angor. Such also is the camel that feeds on thorns-
F or it is said by those who are acquainted with such things,
that thore is no animal so implacable, so sulky and revengeful,
as a camel. Such is wealth. It nourishes the unreasonable
passions of the soul, but it piercos and wounds the rational,
as is the case with thorus. This plant is hard and rough,
and springs up of itself.
