1116 friend of Christ? VVrought he not greater things than ‘
Christ? did he not ofttimes command the devil as a captive
slave? did he not carry him about as an executionerq? did

he not hold him up to scorn? held he not his head bruised
under his seet? did he 1101 with much boldness beg of God

that others too might do the same? Why speak Ι of this?
Absalorn exalted himself, David humbled himself; which of

the twain was raised up, which became glorious? For what
could be a more evident proof of humility than these words
which that blessed Prophet spoke of Shimei, Let him curse‚2 Kings
for the Lord halle. halden 10·φηὶ The Publican humbled 16, 11.
himself, although his aet can hardly be called humility, yet

it was in a right minded manner he spake those things which

he said. The Pharisee exalted himself,—but if it seems good

let us dismiss persons, and search into the matter. Let there

be two men, both rich, and highly honoured, and elevated

by wisdom and power, and other worldly advantages; then

let one of them seek honour from all, let him be angry if he
receive it not, let him require more than is due and exalt
himself ; let the other despise the whole matter, and bear
himself unkindly towards no one on this account, and evade
honour when offered to him. Which then is the greater, he

who receives it 1101 and yet seeks it, or he who despises it
when given? It is plain that the latter is, and with reason3

for it is not possible to obtain glory any other way than by
fleeing stom glory, for as long as we pursue it, it fiies from

uS, but when we fiee from 11, 11 pursues us. If thou wouldest

be glorious, do not desire glory. If 111011 wouldest be lofty,

do not make thyself losty. And further, all honour him who

⁸ does not grasp at glory, but spurn him who seeks it. For

the nature of man somehow or other is fond of contention,

and leans to contrary feeling. Let us therefore despise glory,

for thus we shall be enabled to become lowly‚ and still more

to become exalted. Exalt not thyself, that thou inayest be
exalted by another, he that is exalted by himself is not
exalted by others, he who is humbled by himself 18 1101
