Ver. 7. So that με were ensamples to all that believe in HOM-
Macedonia aud Achaia. 1.

And yet it was later that he went to them. But ye so shone,
he sayS, that ye became instructors of those who received
(the word) before you. And this is like the Apostle.‘²⁹³⁰f⁷⁷⁰·
For he did not say, that ye were ensamples 111 believing, but Nm
ye are an ensample to those who already believed, that is,
how one ought to believe in God, ye taught, who from the
very beginning entered into your conflict.

And in Achaia, he says3 that is, in Greece.

Do you see how great a thing is zeal? that it does not
require time, nor delay, nor procrastination, but it is sufficient
only to venture ¹ one's sels, and all is fulfilled. Thus then :gfff
these, who came in later to the Proclamation, became teachers ⁵
of those who were before them.

Let no one therefore despair, even though he has lostfflomt-

much time, and has done nothing. It is possible for him
even in a little while to do so much, as he never has done in
all his former time. For if he who before did not believe,
shone so much at the beginning, how much more those who
have already believed! Let no 0116, again, upon this con-
sideration be remiss, because he perceives that it is possible
111 3 short time to recover every thing. For the future is
uncertain, and the Day of the Lord is2 a 111161, attacking 1132]3,ῑὃ as
suddenly when we are sleeping. But if we do not sleep, it
will not attack 113 33 3 111161, nor carry us off unprepared.
For 11 we watch and be sober, it will not come on us as 3 thies,
but as a royal messenger, summoning us to the good things
prepared 101· 113. Βι11 11 we sleep, it comes upon us as a
thief. Let no one therefore sleep, nor be inactive in virtue,
for that is sleep. Do you not know how, when we sleep, our
goods are not in sasety, how easy they are to be assailed?
But when we are awake, there needs not so much guarding.
When we sleep, even with much guarding we often perish.
There are doors, and bolts, and guards, and outer guards,
and nevertheless the thief has come upon us.

Why then do I say this? Because, if we wake we shall
not need the help of others, but if we sleep, the help 01
others will profit us nothing, but even with this we shall
perish. It is a good thing to enjoy the prayer of the saints,
