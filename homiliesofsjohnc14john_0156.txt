good, and not that wc should plot one against another. He
gave us a roos, that it might afl'ord shelter from the rain, and
no more, not that it should be decked out with gold, while
the poor man perishes with hunger. He gave clothing to
cover us, not to make a display withal‚ not that things like
these should have much gold lavished upon them, and that
Christ should perish naked. He gave you a place of shelter,
not that you should keep it to yoursclf, but to offer it to
others also. He gave thee land, not that, cutting off the
chief portion of it, you should spend the good gists of God
upon harlots‚ and danem-s, and actors, and flute players, and
harp players, but upon those that hunger and are in want.
He gave you the sea to sail on, that you might not be wearied

But are they stronger? Not even this can be said for them ¹¹.
Well then, are they more useful? are they larger? Not even
this. Whence then are they so admired? From no other
cause than fancy. For if they are neither more beautiful, (for
we shall find others more shining and more white,) nor more ⁰
useful‚ nor stronger, whence came they to be so admired?
VVas it not· from mere fancy? Why then did God give them?
They were not His gift, but it is your own imagination that
they are any thing great. ‘ How is it, then,' 116 answers,
‘ that even the Scripture shews admiration of them ?' So far
