10. ⁷say? Tho earth was divided from heaven, 1110 Angcls were

become cnemies to men, through seeing their Lord insulted.

{pff-‘⁵- To unite under oue head ¹, 110 saith, all tltz'nys in Cleo-ist,

1'E,v', to which, are in heaven, (md which. are z'n earth. How? The

foatelffizi’r things in heaven indeed in this way: He translated Man

Not only made He the things on earthr to be at peace, but

1Ιο brought up to 1110111 him that was their enemy and foe.

Here was peace prosound. Angels again appeared on the

earth thereafter, because that Man too had appeared in

2 Cpr· heaven. And it seems to me that Paul was caught up as

12, 2. well on this account, as to shew that the Son also had been

received up thither. For in the earth indeed, the peace was

twofold3 with the things of heaven, and with themselves3

but in heaven it was simplo. For if the Angels rejoice over

one sinner that repenteth, much more will they over so many.

had against us, how great it was3 and how averse to us they

’ΞᾜΞν cases of the Israelites, of David, of the sodomites, of the
