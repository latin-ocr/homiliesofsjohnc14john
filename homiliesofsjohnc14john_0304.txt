possible to forgive. For it is possible sor one to be kind,
and meek, and humbleminded, and long-suffering, and yet
not affectionatc ¹. And therefore, he said at the first, Bowels
quercy, both love and pity. And ahot-⁶22 all these Μίνῳ-ς,
charin, which is the boml of perfec-thess. Now what he
wishes to say is this; that there is no profit in those things,
for 311 those things fall asunder, except they be done with
lovc; this it is which clenches them all together3 whatsoever
good thing it bc thou mentionest, if charity be away, it is
nothing, it 1116113 away ³. And it is as in a ship, even though

of no service3 and in an house, if there be no tie beams ⁶, it is

there be no ligaments, they are of no service. For whatso-
ever good deeds any may have, all do vanish away, if love be

The peace qs God. This is that which is fixed and sted-
fast. If on man's account indeed thou hast peace, it quickly
comes to dissolution, but if 011 God's account, never.
Although he had spoken of love universally, yet again he
comes to the particular. For there is a love 100 which is
immoderate3 for instance, when out of much love one makes
accusations without reason, and is engaged in contentions,
and contracts aversions. Not this, saith he, not this do I
desire, but 33 God made peace with you, so do ye also make
it. And how made He peace ? Of His own Will, not having
received any thing of you. What is this? Let the peace os
God recle in your hearts. If two thoughts are fighting to-
gether, set not anger, set not spitefulness to hold the prize,
but peace3 for instance, suppose one to have been insulted
unjust1y3 os the insult are born two thoughts, the one
