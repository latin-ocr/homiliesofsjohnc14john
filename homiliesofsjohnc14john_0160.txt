loss, for it is 1101, but because it was impossible 1ο take both
at once, he was compelled to leave onc. Thus too is it here:
the Law is not loss, but for a man to cleave to the Law, and
desert Christ. Wherefore 11 15 111611 1055 when it leads us
away from Christ. But if it sends 115 011 10 Him, it is no
longer so. For this cause he saith it is loss, i. 6. sor Christ
it is loss3 if for Christ, it is not so naturally. But why doth
not the Law suffer us to come to Christ? For this very cause,
he tells us, was it given. And Christ is the fulfilling of the
Law, and Christ is the end of the Law. It doth suffer ns, if
we will obey it; he then who obeyeth the Law, leaves that
same Law. It suffers him, if we take heed to 11, bnt if we
(10 1101 take heed, it suffers him not. Yea dozcbtless, and I
coemi all thiu-qs but loss. Why, 116 means, do Ι say this of
the Law ? Is not the world good ? Is not 1116 present life good?
but if they draw 1116 away srom Christ, 1 6011111 these things

a comparison from superiority, not from diversity of kind3
for that which is superior, is superior 10 somewhat of like
nature to itself. So that he shews the connection of that
knowledge by the same means, by which he draws 1116
superiority from the comparison. F ον Whom. I hare szqffered

things past, and things present, and, if you wish, the Law too,

the strength of the corn is the dung, I mean, 1116 chaff.
therefore the dung was useful in 115 former state. For we
pluck 11 together with the corn, and had there been no dung,
there would have been no corn. Thus too is it with the
Law.
