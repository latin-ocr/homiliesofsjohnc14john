ingenuousness I lay down what our 6116111165 say, for that is a
glorious victory, and fully gained, when we do not conceal
what seen] to be their strong points. Such concealment is
deeeit rather than victory. that then do they say? let me
repeat their argument. To be a man in fashion 15 not 10 be
a man by nature; and to be as a man, and in the fashion
os a man, this is not to be a man. Is then to take the form
of a servant, not to take the form⁰ of a servant? So here is
an inconsisteney ¹3 and wheresore (10 you not first of all solve
this difficulty, for as you think that this contradicts us, 50 (10
we say that the other contradicts you. He says not, “as the
form of a servant‚'’ nor “in the likeness of the form of a
servant‚” nor “ in the fashion of the form of a servant‚'⁷ but
He took tlte-form qfa servant. What then is this? for there
is a contradiction. There is no contradiction. God forbid!
it is a eold and ridiculous argument of theirs. He took, say
they, the form of a servant, when He girded Himself with
a towel‚ and washed 'the feet of His disciples. Is this the
form 01 11 servant? Nay, this is not the form, but the work
of a servant. It is 0116 thing to take f the work of a servant,
and another 10 take the form of servant. Why did he not
say, He did the work of a servant, which were clearer? For
no where in Scripture is form put for ‘⁴ work,” for the differ·
enee is great3 the one is the result of nature, the other of
action. In common speaking too we never use ‘⁶ form” for
‘⁶ work.⁷' Besides, according 10 1116111, Η6 did not even
perform the work of a servant, neither girded Himself. For
if all was a mere shadow, there was 110 reality. If He had
not real hands, how (lid He wash their feet? If He had not
real loins, how did He gird Himself with a towel? and what

his yar-ments. As then not even the work 15 found to have
really taken place, but it was all a deception‚ 50 neither did
He wash the feet of His disciples. For if that incorporeal
nature was 1101 made manifest, itg was not in a body. tho
then washed the disciples’ feet?
