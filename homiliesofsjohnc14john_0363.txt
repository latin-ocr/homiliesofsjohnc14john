one of equal condition ; if however this cannot be,rather one
poor·e1 than in better circumstances3 if at least thou be
desimus not of selling¹ thy daughter to a master, but of1oe’aeoB'-
giving2 her to a husband. When thou hast thoroughly 1n- ρῖωδοῦ Μ
vestigated the virtue of the man, and art about to give her to
him, beseech Christ to be present: for He will not be ashamed
to be so3 it is the mystery of His presence. Yea rather
beseech Him even in the first instance, to grant her such a
suitor. Be not worse than the servant of Abraham, who,
when sent on a pilgrimage so important, knew whither he
ought to have recourse3 wherefore also he obtained every
thing. When thou art taking anxious pains, and seeking a
husband for her, pray; say unto God, ‘ whomsoever Thou wilt
do Thou provide :' into His hands commit the matter3 and He,
honoured in this way by thee, will requite thee with honour.

Two things indeed it is necessary to do; to commit the
thing into His hands, and to seek such a person as He Him-
self would approve, one that is orderly and chaste.

Whend then thou makest a marriage, go not round from
house to house borrowing mirrors and dresses3 for the mat-
ter is not one of display, nor dost thou lead thy daughter to
a pageant3 but decking out thine house with what is in it,
invite thy neighbours, and friends, and kindred. As many as
thou knowest to be of a good character, those invite, and bid
them be content with what there is. Let no one from the
orchestra be present, for such expense is superfluous, and
unbecoming. Before all the rest, invite Christ. Knowest
thou whereby to invite Him? Whosoever, saith He, halle, Mat. 25,
done it to one os these least, halle, done it to Me. And think4⁵
it not an annoying things* to invite the poor for Christ’ s sake3 ·³ δυσά-
to invite harlots is an annoyance. For to invite the poor is²¹'‘⁶'
a means of wealth, the other of ruin. Adorn the bride not
with these ornaments that are made of gold, but with gentle-
ness and modesty, and the customary robes; in place of all
golden ornament and bmiding, arraying her in blushes, and
shamefacedness, and the not desiring such things. Let there
be no uproar, no confusion3 let the bridegroom be called, let
