might be believed. And yet in cases of private death indeed,

it is possible to impute them to a swoon, but here, it is not
possible to do this either. For even the soldiers brake not

His legs, like those of the others, that it might be made
manifest that He was dead. And those who buried The
Body are known3 and therefore too the Jews themselves

seal the stone along with the soldiers. For, what was most

of all attended to, was this very thing, that it should not be

in obscurity. And the witnesses to it are from cnemies, from
Mat.26,tlie Jews. Hear them saying to Pilate, Tkat (leeez'ver said,

'shame. For since the Angels have suffered nothing like it,

He therefore doth every thing for this, shewing that His
death aehieved a mighty work. For there was, as it were, a

single combat. Death wounded Christ: but Christ, being
wounded, did afterwards kill death. He that seemed to be
immortal, was destroyed by a morta] body3 and this the
whole world saw. And what is truly wonderful is, that He
committed not this thing to another. But there was made

again a second lesanrlzm'itiny, of another kind than the former.
