applicable to another, we have not corrected him so much,

For, since continuing in prayers frequently makes persons
listless, therefore he saith, walclzinq, that is, sober, not wan-
dering¹. For the devil knoweth, he knoweth, how great a
good prayer is3 therefore he presseth heavily. And Paul
also knoweth how carelessg many are when they pray, where-
sore he saith, continue ¹¹ in prayer, as of somewhat laborious,
watelziny in the same with tlzanlcsqiviny. For let this, he
saith, be your work, to give thanks in your prayers both for
the seen, and the unseen, and for His benefits to the willing
and unwilling, and for the kingdom, and for hell, and for
tribulation, and for refreshment. For thus is the custom of
the Saints to pray, and to give thanks for the common benefits
of all.

I know a certain holy man who prayeth thus. He used
to say nothing before these words, but thus, “We give
Thee thanks for all Thy benefits shewn forth upon us the
unworthy, from the first day until the present, for what we
know, and what we know not, for the seen, for the unseen,
for those in deecl‚ those in word, those with our wills, those
against our wills, sor all that have been bestowed upon the
unworthy, even us; for tribulations, for refreshments, for
hell, for punishment, for the kingdom of heaven. We
bescech Thee to keep our soul holy, having a pure con-
science3 an end worthy of Thy lovingkindness. Thou
that lovedst us so as to give Thy Only-Begotten for us,
grant us to become worthy of Thy lovo3 give us wisdom in
Thy word, and in Thy sear, Only-Begottcn Christ, inspire the
strength that is from Thee. Thou that gavest Thy Only-
Begottcn for us, and hast sent Thy Holy Spirit for the remis-
sion of our sins, isin aught we have wilfully or unwillingly
