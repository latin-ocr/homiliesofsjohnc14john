1Τιῑεε. 0116 of my acquaintance interposing himself said, that then

„33ssss of fornication, is it not possible both to love, and to
commit fornicationi? And indeed this springs from lox-0¹¹¹.
Covetousness indeed, and adultery‚ and envy, and hostile
designs, and every thing of this sort can cut one off from the
love of his neighbour; but how does fornication? he said.
l therefore told him, that even this can love prevent. For if
a man loves a woman that commits fornication, he will
endeavour both to draw her off from other men, and not
himself also to add to her 8111. So that to commit fornication
with a woman is the part of 0116 exceedingly hating her with
whom 116 60111111118 1116 fornication, but one who truly loved
her would withdraw 1161· from that abominable practice.
And there is not, there is not any sin, which the power of
love, like fire, cannot consume. For it is easier for a vile
faggot to resist a great pile of 1116, 111611 for the nature of sin
to resist the power of love.

This then let us plant in our own souls, that we may stand
with all 1116 Saints. For they all pleased God by their love
to 111611 neighbour. Whence was Abel slain, and did not
slay? Surely from his excessive love to his brother, he
could not even admit such a thought. &Vhence did that Cain
receive the destructive pest of envy? For I will no longer
call him the brother of Abel! Because the foundations of
love had not been firmly fixed in him. Whence did the
sons of Noah obtain a good report? was it not because they
loved their father exceedingly, and did not endure to see 1118
exposure'? And whence was the other cursed? was it not
from not loving him? And whence did Abraham obtain a
good report? was it not from love that he did what 116 (11(1
10 1118 nephew? what he did in his supplication for the
Sodomites. For strongly, strongly, were the Saints affected
with love and with sympathy.

For consider, I pray, how Paul was affected with love, who
was bold in the face of 1116, 1161·(1 as adamant, firm and un—
shaken, on every side compact, rivetted in the sear of God‚
