and instructing them to bear death gladly for Christ’s sake.

I am become, he sayS‚ as it were a libation and a sacrifice.
O blessed soul ! His bringing them to God he calls a sacrifice,
which teaches us that it is much better to present a soul than
to present oxen3 ⁶ if now, then, over and above this offering,'
he says, ‘ I add myselflikewise, as a drink-offering, I have joy in

sacrifice 3 sor tlte same cause also clo pse joy and rejoice with
me, that I am offered up; ReJ'oa'ce with me, he says, ‘ who do
myself rejoice at my death? So that the death of the just is
no subject for tears, but for joy. If they rejoice, we should
rejoice with them. For it is misplaced for us to weep, while
they rej oice. ‘ But,' it is urged, ‘ we long for our wonted inter-
course.’ This is a mere pretext and excuse3 and that it is
so, mark what 116 bids the Philippians3 Rejoice with, me, (md
joy. And dost thou miss thy wonted intercourse? If thou wert
thyself destined to remain here, there would be reason in
what thou sayest; but if after a brief space thou wilt overtake
him, who has departed, what is that intercourse which thou
dost seek? for it is only when heis for ever severed from him
