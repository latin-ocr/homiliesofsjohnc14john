158 Rejoict‘ny in 1116 Lord. Remotis-lor patience.

stand for with: as is he had said, Rejoe'ce with tlte Lord
alecoy, aud ayain I say, Iu'ejoc'ec. These arc the words of 0116
who brings comfort, of onc who shews that hc who is 111
God rejoiceth alway. Yca though 116 116 afflictod, yea what-
ever hc may suffer, such a man alway rejoiceth. H ear what
Luke saith of 1116 Apostles3 that they returned from the
presence os 1116 Counce'l, rcjoiciny that they were conntecl
wortley to bc beatenfor His mtme. Is scourging and bonds,
which 56611110 116 1116111051 grievous of all things, produce
joy, what else will be able to produce grief in us?

Ayae'n I Say, Rejoz'ce. Well hath he repeated the word.
For since the nature of the things produceth grief, he shews

Are ye 111 affliction, whilst they are iu luxury ? These things
shall shortly receive thcir end. Do they plot against you,
and threaten you? But these things shall not at last 111111 0111

things shall be reversed. Be eanszclsor notlziny. Already
the recompense is at hand. If ye are kindly affected toward
those, who prepare evil against you, if povcrty, if death, if
aught else that is terrible 116 upon you, all these things shall
disappear. Be cat-qsalfhr nolltiny, bnt in every tlu'uy, by
prayer and snpplication, wille ilnmlssylriny, 161 your requests
be maele known emto God. There is this for one consolation,
the Lorcl is at hand. And again, I will be with you alway,
even mato the end oftlee world. Behold another consolation,
a medicine, which healeth grief, and distress, and all that is
