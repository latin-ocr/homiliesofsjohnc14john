the mercy of God? This made all things, this formed the
world, this made y the angels, it was through mere goodness².
For this cause too He threatened hell, that we may attain
unto the kingdom, and through mercy we do attain unto the
kingdom. For wherefore, tell me, did God, being alone,
create all things? was it not through goodness? was it not

quench the fire, and bring light to us. Thus by this means
shall we be freed from the fire of hell. For whence will Godb
be compassiouate and shew mercy? Does not mercy come of
love? Nothing incenses God so much as to be pitiless. “ A
