which arise from the table, sor these wc arc forbidden
10 carry in Thither. For hear Christ sayiug in the
Gospel, Call not thy friends nor thy neighbours, if thou
make-st a feast, but the lame, 1110 maimed. With reason:
sor great is the 101-0111110030 for these. But thou canst
not, nor endurest to feast with lame and blind, but
thinkcst 11 grievous and offensive, and refusest. Now it
were indeed best that thou shouldest not refuso, however it
is not necessary to do it. lf thou scatest them not with thee,
send to them of the dishes on thy own table. For he that
inviteth his friends, hath done no great thing: for he hath
received his recompense herc. But he that called the
maimed, and poor, hath God for his Debtor. Let us then not
repine when we receive not a reward here, but when we do
receive here; for we shall have nothing more to receive There.
In like manner, if man recompenso, God recompenscth 1101 ;
if man recompenso not, then God will rccompense. Let us
111011 not seek those 0111 for our benefits, who have it 111 111011·
power to requite us again, nor bestow our fitvours on them
with such an expectation: this were a cold thought. lf
thou invite a friend, the obligation is but till evening3 and
therefore the friendship is sooner spent than is the eost, or
the minutes of the feast. But if thou call the poor and the
maimed, never shall the obligation be lost, for God, tho
remembereth ever, and never forgetteth, thou hast even Him
sor thy Debtor. that squeamishness ¹is this, pray, that thou
canst not sit down in company with the poor? What sayest
thou? He is unclean and filthy? Then wash him, and lead
him to thy table. But he hath filthy garments? Then change
them, and give him clean apparel. Seest thou not how
great ι1110 gain is? Christ cometh unto thee through him,
and dost thou make petty calculations of such things? W'hen
thou art inviting 1110 King to thy table, dost thou sear because
of such things as these ?

Lei us suppose two tames, and 101 0110 110 filled with those,
and have the blind, the halt, the maimed 111 hand 01· leg, the
barefoot, those clad with but 0110 scanty coat, and that worn
