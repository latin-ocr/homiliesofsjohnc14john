expectest not to be found fault with, dost thou find fault with XI.
the Lord, who out of lnercy does not hear His servant?
Seest thou how great the inequality, how great the in-
justice?

Let us consider these things constantly, those who are
below us, those who are under greater calamities, and so we
shall be able to be thankful to God. Life abounds with many
such instances. And he who is sober, and willing to attend,
gains no small instruction from the houses of prayer. For·
on this account the poor sit before the vestibule both in the
churches and in the chapels 01 1116 Martyrs‘, that we may
receive great benefit from the spectacle of these things. For
consider, that when wo enter into earthly palaces, we cau see
nothing of this kind 3 but 111611 11161 616 dignified and famous,
and wealthy and intelligent, are every where hastening to and
sro. But into the real palaces, I mean the Church, and the
oratories¹ of the Martyrs, enter the demoniacs, the maimed,l sam„-
the poor, the aged, the blind, and those whose limbs are {2522OE
distorted. And wherefore ? That thou mayest be instruoted
by the spectacle of these things3 in the first place that if thou
hast entered drawing· aster thee any pride 110111 without, having
looked upon these, and laid aside thy arrogance, and become
contrite in heart, so thou mayest go in, and hear the things
that are said, for it is not possible that he who prays with
an arrogant mind should be heard. That when thou seest an
aged man, thou mayest not be elated at thy youth, 101· these
old men were once young. That when thou boastest highly
of thy warfarc, or thy kingly power, thou inayest consider
that from these are sprung even those who are become
illustrioris in kings' courts. That, when thou presumest
upon thy bodily health, taking heed to these, thou mayest
abate thy losty spirit. For 1116 healthy 111611 who con-
tinually enters here, will not 116 higlnninded 011 account of
his bodily 11661111. And the sick inan will receive no little
consolation.
