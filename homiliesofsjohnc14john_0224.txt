the glory os God. And the praise too, which cometh of
men, attendeth more abundantly upon this, for that man
is even regarded with an envious eye3 but this all men
regard as their common father, even they who have received
110 benefit at his hands. And as with the injured even they
who have not been injured sympathize, and all become in
common enemies (to the injurer): so 100, when any have
received kindness, they also who have not received any3 not
less than they who have, praise and admire him that conserred

what need, tell me, when every thing might be done pro-
fitably, to make a division, and 10 expend part not only
on what is not wanted, but even without any purpose at all,
and part profitably? Tell me, hadst thou, when sowing,
east some upon a rock, and some upon very good ground3
