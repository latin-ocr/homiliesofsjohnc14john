And he has well introduced the words, We hare confi-
dence in- tlte Lorcl, that is, we trust to His lovinglzindness.
Again he brings them down, making every thing depend
thereupon. For if he had said, We have confidence in you,
the commendation indeed was great, but it would not have
shewn that in all things they were dependent upon God.

But if he had said, But we have confidence in the Lord,

that He will preserve you, and had not added as tozcclzinfs

Mammon, laying, as it were, certain shameless hands upon
our 50111, and tenaciously holding it in its grasp, draws and
drags 115 thence even against our will. Then vain-glory, and
often afflictions and temptations‚ turn us aside. For this
reason we need, as a certain wind, the assistance of God,
that our sail may be impelled‚ as by some strong wind, to
the love of God. For tell me not, ‘ I love Him, even more
than myself.’ These are words. Shew it by thy works, if
