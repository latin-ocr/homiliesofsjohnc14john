with the king, for both are called together, and thou perhaps
disdainest even to be seen giving to the poor, or even 6011- ³⁰)
versing with them? Fie upon thy haughtiness and pride!

See that we suffer not the same with the rich man formerly.
He disdained even to look upon Lazarus, and did not allow
him to share his roof, or a corering, but he was without, cast
away at his gate, nor was he even vouchsafed a word from
him. But 566 how, when fallen into straits, and in want 01
1115 help, he failed to obtain it. For if we are ashamed of
those of whom Christ is not ashamed, we are ashamed of
Christ, being ashamed of His friends. Let thy table be
filled with the maimed and the lame. Through them Christ
6011165, 1101 through the rich. Perhaps thou laughest at
hearing this; therefore, that thou mayest not think it is my
word, hear Christ Himself speaking, that thou mayest not
laugh, but shuddor: When thou mah-est a dinner or α supper, Mat.14‚
He says, eall not thy friends ozor thy hretlzren, neither thy12‘14·
kinsnzen, nor tlzy ricla neisslzbourS, lest they also hid tlzee
aqaz‘n, and a reeompenee be maele tlzee. But when thou
nmlcest a feast, eall tlze poor, tlze vfzaimed, the blind, ancl thou
slzalt be blessed. For they cannot recompensa) tlzee: for
thou skalt be reeompensed at tlze Resurrection of llze just.

from those guests arise envy, and malice, and slanders, and
revilings, and much sear lest any thing unbeeoming should
occur. And thou standest like 3 servant before his master, if
those who are invited are thy superiors, fearing their criti-
615111 and their lips. But 111 1116 6356 01 111656 there 15 nothing
of this sort, but whatever you bring them, they receive all
with pleasure3 and thence comes great applause, brighter
glory, and higher admiration. All they that hear do not so
much applaud the former, as the latter. But if thou dis-
believest, thou who art rich, make the trial, thou who in-
vitest generals and governors. Invite also the poor, and fill
thy table from them, and 566 is 111011 art not applauded by
all, 11 111011 311 1101 loved by all, if 311 do not hold thee 35 3
father. For of those 163515 there is no advantage, but for
these heaven is 111 store, and the good things of heaven—of
which God grant we may all be partakers, by the grace
