lTnnshas offended rue, and done me much injury. Do you wish
δ’ 16-18. to revenge yourself upon him ? Do not retaliate. Leave him
unrevcngcd. What, sor this once‘? By no means 3

But ever follow clarat wlaielz is qood, bocla among) yourselves,
and to all men.

This is the higher philosophy, not only not to requite evil
with evil, but to render good sor evil. For this is truly
revenge, that brings harm to him and advantage to thyself‚
or rather great advantage oven to him, if he will. And that
thou rnayest not think that this is said only with respect
to the faithful, therefore he has said, botlz amous) yourselves
and to all men.

Ver. 16. qu‘oice evermore.

This is said with respect to the temptations that cause
affliction. Hear ye, as many as have fallen into poverty‚
or into adverse circumstances. For from these joy is en-
gendered. For when we possess such a soul that we take
revenge on no one, but do good to all, whence, tell me, will
the sting of grief be able to enter into us? For he who so
rejoices in suffering evil, as to requite even with benefits
him that has done him evil, whence can he afterwards suffer
grief? And how, you say, is this possible? It is possible,
if we will. Then also he shews the way.

Ver. 17, 18. Pray ‘eL-illmut ceasiay. ln every tlziny (live
thanim: for clais is tlte will (ff Gocl.

Always to give thanks, this is a mark of a philosophie
soul. Hast thou suffered any evil? But if thou wilt, it
is no evil. Give thanks to God, aud the evil is changed into

Job 1, good. Say thou also as J ob said, Blessecl be tlze name oftlze
21. Lordsor ever. For tell me, what such great thing hast thou
suffered? Has disease besallen thee? Yet it is nothing strange.
For our body is mortal, and liablc to suffer. Has a want of
possessious overtaken thee? But these are things to be
acquired, and again to be lost, and that abide here. But
is it plots and salse accusations os cnemies? But it is not
we that are injured by these, but they who are the authors os
Ezek- them. For the soal, ho says, tlmc sinnellz, «it shall die. And

18, 4. he has not sinned who suffers the evil, but he who has done
the evil.
