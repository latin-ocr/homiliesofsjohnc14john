kappen that every one who findellc me will slay me. Tell
me then, do not many even now do the same things that he
did? For when thou slayest not thy brother according to
the flesh, but thy spiritual brother, dost thou not do the
same? For what, though not by the sword? yet by some
other means. When being able to relieve his hunger, thou
neglectest him. What then? Has no one now envied his

Then did he, who never heard the written laws‚ nor the

spared contrary to the command of G0d‚ suffered so great
punishment. Has no one from that time spared? Would
indeed that it were so! Have we not rather devoured one
another contrary to the command of God? And yet no one
has fallen in warn. Again, the sons of Eli, because they ate
before the incense was offered, suffered the most severe
punishment together with their father. Has no father then
been neglectful with respect to his children ? and are there
