Is it not then manifest, that it is because they do not choose I·
to contribute any thing os themselves ¹? Prayers, then,
profit greatly, but it is when we also contribute our own
parts.

Would you learn how much prayers have profited? consi· Acts 10,
der, I pray, Cornelius, Tabitha. Hear also Jacob saying to ἐζ ζὲξῑ
Laban, Except tlte Fear Qf my father lzacl been 202·th me, Gen.31‚
surely thou lzaclst seut me away now empty. H ear also God 42'
again, saying, I will defend this eityfor Mine own sake, aud 2 Kings

Samuel stood before Me. 15, 1·
And see how this is said to the two Prophets,because both
