Sin of mnrmuriny. Trz'als of Job. 95

ing is left for unprincipled and graceless slaves3 for tell me,
what manner of son is that, who murmurs at the very time
that he is employed in the affairs of his father, and is working
for his own benefit? Consider, he says, that you are labour-
ing for yourself, that it is for yourself that you are laying up3
it is for those to murmur, when others profit by their labours,
others reap the fruit, while they bear the burthen; but he that
is gathering for himself, why should he murmur? Because
his wealth does not increase? But this is not the case. Why
does he murmur who acts of free-will, and not by constraint?
Itis better to do nothing than to do it with murmuring, for
even the very thing itself is spoilt3 and do you not remark
that in our own faniilies we are continually saying this3 ‘ it
were better for these things never to be done, than to have
them done with murmuring ?’ and we had often rather be
deprived of the services some one owes uS, than submit to
the inconvenience of his murmuring. For murmuring is
intolerable, most intolerable3 it borders upon blasphemy.
Otherwise why had those men to pay a penalty so severe?
Itis a proof of ingratitude3 the murmurer is ungrateful to God,
but whoso is ungrateful to God does thereby become 3
blasphemer. Now there were at that time, if ever, uninter-
rupted troubles, and dangers without cessation: there was no
pause, no remission: innumerable were the horrors, which
pressed upon them from all quarters, but now we have pro-
found peace, 3 perfect calm.

Wherefore then murmur? Because thou art poor? Yet
think of Job. Or because sickness is thy lot? What then if,
with the consciousness of as many excellencies and as high
attainments as that holy man, thou hadst been so afflicted?
Again reflect on him, how that for a long time he never
ceased to breed worms, sitting upon a dunghill an‘d scraping

your child is dead? What then if thou hadst lost all thy
children, and that by an evil fate, as he did? For ye know,
ye know well, that it is no slight alleviation to take our place
beside the sick man, to press mouth to mouth, to close the
eyes, to stroke the beard, to hear the last accents; but that
