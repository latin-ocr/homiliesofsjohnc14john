HOMILY Vll.

l Tmzss. iv. 13.

But I would not have yon to be iqrzorant, brelhren, concern-
inq them which are asleep‚ thal ye sorrow not even as
others which have no hope.

THERE are many things which from ignorance alone cause
us sorrow, so that if we come to understand them well, we
banish our grief. This therefore Paul also shewing, says,
J would not have yon to be iynorant, that με sorrow not even
as others which have no hope. Of what wouldest thou not
have them ignorant? The doctrine, he says, of the Resur-
rection. But wherefore dost thou not speak of the punish-
ment laid up for being ignorant of the doctrine of the Resur-
rection? Because this is manifest from the other, and is
admitted. But meanwhile, together with that, there will
also be this not inconsiderable gain. For since they did not
disbclieve the Resurrection, but nevertheless bewailed, on
this account he thus speaks. And he discourses indeed with
those who disbelieve the Resurrection in one way, but with*
these in another. For it is manifest that they knew, who

lThess, were inquiring about the times and sea-sons.

5,1.

Ver. 14. For {fwe hellene, he says, that Jesus died and

rose (φαίη, [and lived ³,] esen« so them also which sleep in
Jesns will God brino with him.

⁵¹ This word seems to come from Rom. 14, 9. Β. and L. omit it.
