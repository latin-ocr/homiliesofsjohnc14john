tious improve it. W herefore also fearsul discourses make it
sober. For the soul is like any wax. For if you apply cold
discourses, you harden and make it callous; but if fiery ones,
you melt it3 and having melted it, you form it to what you
will, and engrave the royal image upon it. Let us therefore
stop up our ears to discourses that are vain. It is no little

that discourses are to souls. WVherever you will, you may
move and turn it. For this reason one exhorting says, Let
‘l‘y whole discam-se be in the law of the Most He'ylc. W here-

infixed in their minds that there is a punishment. This sear
being rooted in them produces great good effects. For a

this expectatimn will not soon shake off this sear. But like
