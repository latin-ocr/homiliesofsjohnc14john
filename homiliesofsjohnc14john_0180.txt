}me„ draggest thy soul to the earth with luxury, and takest no heed
δ’ 21. of this, tell mc dost thou laugh, and art oveljoycd? And
what pardon wilt 'thou obtain sor thy utter want of feeling ?
then thou oughtcst to render even thy body spiritual3 sor
thou mayest, if thou wilt. Thou hast received a belly, that
thou mayest seed, not distend it, that thou mayest have the
mastery over it, not have it as mistress over thee: that it may
minister to thee for the nourishment of the other parts, not
that thou lnayest minister to it, not that thou mayest exceed
limits. The sea, when it passes its bounds, doth not work
so many evils, as the belly doth to our body, together with
our soul. The former overfioweth all the earth, the latter all
the body. Put moderation for a boundary to it, as God hath
put the sand for the sea. Then if its wax-cs arise, and rage

Let us not then seek for ease here, let us wish to shine there,
where our conversation is. From whence also, saith he, we

(slot-dous body. By little and little he hath carried us up. He
saith, From Heaven, and Om· S'avimcr, shewing‚ from the
place, and from the Person, the dignity of the subject.
Wlm shall chansye our vile body, saith he. Our body now
suffereth many things: it is bound with chains, it is scmrrged,
it suffereth innumerable evils3 but the Hody of Christ suffered
the same. This he hintcd at, when he said, leat it may be
‚lh-sltz'oned like welo His [flerimus- body. therefore the body
is the same, but putteth on incorruption. Sleccll chansye,
