but, Where is Moses? and his very presence¹ was fearful. HOM-
So when they did amiss, observe how he punished 1116111.Ι ἔξω
For God indeed was desimus of casting them off ‘³3 but he mnf.

He being as it were a Father threatening, whilst Moses, like

a schoolmaster, was entreating Him, and saying, ⁶ Forgive
them, I pray, on my account, and henceforward Ι undertake

for them.' In this way was the wilderness a school. And

as children who have been a long while at school are desir-

ous of quitting it, so also were they at that time continually
desiring Egypt, and weeping, saying, ‘ We are lost, we are Effod-
wholly consumed, we are utterly undone? And Moses broke ω’ 3'
their tablet, upon which he had written for them, as it weressssxod·
certain words ; doing just as a schoohnaster would do 3 who ’3,ῗῇιὲζῶ
having taken up the writing tablet, and found it badly
written, throws away the tablet itself, desiring to shew the
greatness of his anger 3 and if he have broken it, the father is

not angry. For he indeed was busy writing, but they not
attending to him, but turning themselves other ways, were
committing disorder. And as in school, the boys strike ³ each ³ ‘²¹5⁷'-
other, 50 also, on that occasion, he bade them strike and ξέζῖη

learnt them, he would punish thern. To instance what I

say. The events in Egypt were letters denoting the power

of God. Yes, saith 0116, but these letters represented the
plagues. True, and that He punishes His cnemies. And

to them it was strictly a school. For what else was the
punishment of your enemies but your benefit? And in other
respects too, He benefitted you. And it was the same as if

one should say he knew his letters, but when asked up and
down⁴¹, should be at fault, and be beaten. So they also said‘* croesi—
indeed that they knew the power of God, but when asked '⁷⁹'
their knowledge up and down, they could not give it, and
therefore were beaten. Hast thou seen water5? Thou⁵i·e· of
oughtest to be reminded of thc vwater in Egypt. For Hc {QZ-Bm
that of water made blood, will be also of power to do this g.

As we also say often to the children, ⁴ when in a book thou

sccst the letter A, remember that thou hadst it in thy tablet.'
