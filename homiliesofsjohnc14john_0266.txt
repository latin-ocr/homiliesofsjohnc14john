But now is made manufest, he saith. I-le saith not, ‘ is come
to pass,' but, is macie 772(c›1{s'e.3t to His saints. So that it is
even now still hid, since it is made manifest to His saints
alone.

Lct them not therefore deceive you, for they know not why
it is so to thom alone. To whom He willed, he saith. See
how every where He stops the mouth of their questions. To
whom God ‘ecilled lo make known, he saith. Yet His will is
not without reason ¹. But he said this to make them ac-
countable for grace, rather than allowing them to have high
thoughts, as though it were of their own achieving. What
is the riches of the ylory of this mys-lory among] the Gentiles.
He hath spoken losti1y3 and accumulated emphasis, secking,
out of his great earnestness 2, sor amplification upon amplifi-
cation. For this also is an amplification, the saying indefi-
nitoly, The riche-s· of the {slory (gf this mystergs antony tlte
Gentiles. For it is most of all apparent among the Gentiles,
as he also says elsewhere, Ama {leat the Gentiles misse! ylorfflq

cast out, and make him all at once into a man, and to dis-
play him upon the royal 11110110. For observe, they were
wont to worship stones and the earth3 but they learned that
themselves are better both than 1110 heaven and the 51111, and
that tho whole world serveth them, they were captives and
prisoners of tho devil: 011 a sudden they are placed above
his head, and lay commands on him and scourge him : from
being servants and slaves to demons, they are become the
body os T 110 Master of 1110 Angcls and the Archangels3 from
not knowing omn what God is, they aro become all at once
sharers 011-11 111 God's throno. Wouldcst thou see 1110 count-
