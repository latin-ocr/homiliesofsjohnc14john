me into longing to soc Paul bound, and in his bonds writing,

and preaching, and baptizing, and catechizing. In his bonds

he was referred to on behalf of the Churehes every where3

in his bonds he builded up incalculably. Then was he

’.ὅμως rather at large¹. For hear him saying, So that many of

less this one than that, for this enjoyeth more of Providence

he glorieth no inore of doing, but of suffering. *And this,
