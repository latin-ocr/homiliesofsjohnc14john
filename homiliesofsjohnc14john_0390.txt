ΙΤΗεε. ofyou, that: ye would wall.- u· orthy os God, Who hath called
'3³³⁴ 6'you unto His hinydom and Jlor J then he has said,
chatye'ny you, then he makes mention os fathers, shewing
that although we charged, it was not violently, but like
fathers. Erery one ofyou. Strange ! in so great a multitude
to omit no ono, neither small nor great, neither rich nor
poor. Exhortc'ny you to what, does he say? To bear all
things. And confforlt‘ny and charyiny. Exhortt'ny ὓ, there-
fore they did not seek glory3 and charyiny, therefore they
did not flatter. That ye would wall»- worthy of God, Who
hath called you to His lcinydom and ylory. Observe again,
how, in relating, he both teaches and comforts. For if He
hath called them unto His kingdom ⁰, they ought to endure
all things. We entreats you, not that you should grant us
any favour, but that you should gain the kingdom of heaven.

Ver. 13. For this cause also tleanlc we God without ceasiny,
because when ye recet'ced the word os God, which ye have

is in truth, the word of God, which effectually work-eth also
in you that bellet-e.

It cannot be said, he says, that we indeed do all things
unblameably, but you have done things unworthy of our
conversation. For hearing us, you were not affected as hear-
ing men, but ye gave such heed, as if God Himself were
exhorting you. VVhence is this manifest? Because as he

way in which he acted, that he did not preach with fiattery
or vain—glory3 so from their trials, he shews also that they
rightly received the word. For whence, he says, unless ye
had heard as if God were speaking, did ye endure such
perils? And observe his dignity.

Ver. 14, 15, 16. For ye, hrethren, became followers of the
C'hztrehes os God, which. ιή, Judcea are in Christ destas ; sor
ye also hat-e setffered like thinys of your own countrymen,
even as they havefrom the Jews: tho both killed the Lord
Jesus, and their own prophet-9, (md have persecuted -ιιε, and
they pletas-e hot God, and are contrary to all meu; Forhid-
dc'ny ux to spealc to the Gentiles that they miyht be saved, lo
