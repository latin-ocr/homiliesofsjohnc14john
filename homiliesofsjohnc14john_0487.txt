upon the intrusion of some worldly care, such as happens in
families, forgot the matter. Then suddenly late in the after-
noon, the most awful adjuration came into her mind, and
she felt great compunction, and she went and with great
earnestness asked, and obtained her request. And that very
night she suddenly saw the heavens opened, and beheld
Christ Himself. But she beheld Him, as far as it is possible
for a woman to behold Him. For because she at all

And our great wickedness compels him that is in calamity
or is straitened by hunger, when begging, to utter encomiums
upon our beauty. And I wish this were all. But there is
even another form worse than this. It compels the poor to
