114 Christ’s illinisters why not clollted by miracle.

messenyer, and him that mim'stered to my want& For indeed
he was siclt, mssqlz mtto deatlm but God had merc-y οη him,
and not on ln'm only, but οη me also. So that they were
subject to every sort of sickness. What then? must they
die? By no means· For what cause then did Christ at that
time give them that command? To shew His own power,
and to prove that in aster times He was able to do it, though
He did it not. But whorefore did He not do it? They were
much more admirable than the Israelites, whose shoes did
not wax old, neither their garmentS, and that too whilst they
were journeying through that desert where the glowing rays
of the sun strike so hot, that they consume even stones.
Why then did 116 order it thus? For thy sake. For since
thou wouldest not remain in health, but be full of wounds,
He gave you that which might serve for medicine. And
this is hence manifest ; for tell me, could He not Himself
have fed them? If he gave to thee, who wast at enmity with
Him, would He not much more have given to Paul? He
who gave to the IsraeliteS, those murmurers, those fornicators,
those idolaters, would He not much more have given to
Peter, who lest all for His sake? He who suffered wieked
men to possess ought, would He not much more have sreely
given to John, who for Him forsook hjs father? Yet He
would not: through your hands he feeds them, that you may
be sanctified. And see the excess of His lovingkindness.
He chose that His disciples should be in want, that thou
mightest be a little refreshed.

But you say, if He had freed them from all want, they
would have been much more admirable, far more glorious.
But then that which is to thee salvation would have been
cut off. God willed not then that they should be admirable,
but that they should rather bc lowered, that thou mightest be
saved. He hath suffered them to be less accounted of, that
thou mightest be able to bc saved. The Teacher who re-
ceiveth is not equally reverenced, but he who receives not
is chiefly honoured. But then in the latter case the disciple
is not bencfitted, he is hindered of his fruit. Seest thou the
wisdom of God who thus loveth man? For as He Himself
sought not His own glory, nor had respect to Himself, but
when He was in glory‚ chose to be dishonoured for thy sake,
