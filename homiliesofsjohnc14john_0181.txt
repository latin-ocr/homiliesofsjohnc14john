The Resurrection. Miser-y qfifalliwyfivm ylory. 151

He saith, our vile body, because it is now humbled, subject
to destruction, to pain, because it seemeth to be worthlcss,
and to have nothing beyond that of other animals. Thac it
may besa-slaionecl like 7777ῑο His ylorious Bady. What? shall
this our body be fashioned like unto Him, tho sitteth at
the right haud of the Father, to Him Who is worshipped by
the Angels, before W'hom do stand the incorporeal Powers,
to Him tho is above all rule, and power, and might? Ifthen
the whole world were to take up weeping and lament for
those who have fallen from this hope, could it worthily
lament? because, when a promise is given us of our body
being made like to Him, it still departs with the Devils. l
speak not os Hell now3 whatever can be said, Ι consider
nothing ⁰ to this falling off. that sayest thou, O Paul ? To
be made like unto Him? Yes, he answereth3 then, lest you
should disbelieve, he addcth a reason; Accordiny lo the
worlriny wlzereby He 2⁰8 able even to subdue all tleiozys 7777ίο
Himself. He hath power, saith he, to subdue all things
unto Himself, wherefore also destruction and death. Or
rather, He doth this with the same power. For tell me, which
requireth the greater power, to subject demons, and Angels,
and Archangels, and Cherubim, and Seraphim, or to make
the body incorruptible and immortal? The latter certainly
(would He do) rather than the former3 he shewed forth
the greater works of His power, that you might believe these
too. Wherefore, though ye see these men rejoicing, and
honoured, yet stand firm, be not offended at them, be not
moved. These our hopes are sufficient to raise up even
the most sluggish and indoleut.

Chap. iv. ver. 1. Therefore, saith he, my bretlzren, clearly
belot-ed ancl lonyea'sor, my joy (md eroum, so standsast in
tlte Lord, my clearly belovea'.

So. How? As you have stood, unmoved. See how he
addeth praisc aster exhortation‚ my joy and my crown, not
simply joy but glory too, not simply glory but my crown too.
Which glory nought can equal, since it is the crown of Paul.
So stand fast m the Lon& my (Zearly belot-eal, i. e. in the
hope of God. ⁴

‘¹ Mar, ‘ After falling from so great glory, Ι consider hell nothing?
