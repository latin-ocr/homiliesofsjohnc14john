when men are willing3 as nothing is easy, when they are un- HOM-
willing3 for we are masters of all these things. On this V. —

And again, [f γε be zmwillinq, and hear not. So that all ξθῖξὸ.
depends upon being willing or unwilling. On this account

being of those who are praised, we may obtain the promised
blessings, by the grace and lovingkindness, &c.
