also been punished for it? Thou hast put on the Lord of
Heaven, and of the Angels, and art thou still busied about
earth?
I have spoken thus, because love of ornament is of itself
a great evil, even were no other gendered by it, and it were
possible to hold it without peril, (sor it inciteth¹ to vainglory1 ἀλεχφῃ,
and to pride,) but now many other evils are gendered by23 Mss.

speakings, occasions of rapacity. For why dost thou adom fest’
thyself? Tell me. Is it that thou mayest please thy husband?
Then do it at home. But here the reverse is the case. For
if thou wouldest please thine own husband, please not others 3
but if thou please others, thou wilt not be able to please
thine own. So that thou shouldest put away all thine orna-

from a harlot? Iu that the one regardeth one thing only,
namely, that by the beauty of her person she may attract to

given to us the ornament⁵ of the soul, adorn us, and clothe2⁴2⁹5ff w
us with His own glory, that all shining brightly in good μ
works, and living unto His glory, we may send up glory to
the Father‚ and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.
