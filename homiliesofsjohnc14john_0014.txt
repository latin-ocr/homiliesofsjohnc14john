llom. ix. points out one great uso os 1110 Psalms,1·0r moral
impressi0n‚ and at the same time draws the necessary dis-
tinction between that and the higher aim of Hymns. In
these 'Homilies he is particularly severe 011 luxury and dis-
play, by his attacks on which he is known to have incurred
the displeasure of the Empress Eudoxia, and much persecu-
11011 from 1101.

Α passage on the Holy Sacraments 111 1110 end of Hom. vi.
on Colossinus, one on Prayers for the departed in Hom. iii.
on philippians, and one in which he urges persons at 01111111)Γ
to immediate reconciliation, Hom. vi. on 1 Τ11038111011111115, as
well as that in Hom. iii. in Colossians, on unworthiness of
Ministers‚ and several hints that occur about the order of
Divine service, are well worthy of remark.

Savile's text, with some comparison of others, was used sor
the Homilies 011 1110 Philippians, and that 01 1110 new Paris
Edition, with Savile always 111 hand, 101· 1110 rest. Collations
of one ΜΞ. 111 British Museum, (Burney 48. here marked B.)
were also in hand, but those 01 Mss. 111 Venice and Florence
came too late for part os 1110 work. The want of them is 1101
however very material. The Bodleian Ms. referred 10, as
well as the Catena published by Dr. Cramer, contain only
extracts. lt is hopecl that the H omilies on Ξ Cor. will have
the benefit os a well-adjusted text before the Translation is
published, as they are preparing for publication by Mr. Field,
whom the Editor has to thank for information on some par-
ticulars, as well as for the benefit of having his accurate
edition of the Homilies 011 St. Matthew 10 refer to.
