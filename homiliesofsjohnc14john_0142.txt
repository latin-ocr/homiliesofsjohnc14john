so ? If they be truc, in that ye judgc your Teaclie1·S,and sub-
vert order, ye do it to your hurt. For if we must not judgc
a brother, much less a Teacher. But if they be salse, the
punishment and retribution is intolerable3 sor of every idle
word {leat men shall spealc they shall (live account. For
your sake then I thus act and labour.

But as I said, no one searches out these things, no one
busies himself about these things, no one comumnes with
himself on any of these things. Would ye that I should add
still more? Wlaosoever sorsaketla not all llzcct lze laath, is not
wortlzy ofMe. What when He sayS, It is hczrclfor a ricla man
to enter into tlze Icinydom of heaven 52 that when He says
again, Woe nnto you that are rz'elz,f0r ye leave received your
consolation? No one searches this out, no one bears it in
mind, no one reasons with himself, but all sit as severe inqui-
sitors on other men's cases. Yet this is to make themselves
sharers in the charges. But listen, that for your own sake I
may free the priests from the charges, which ye say lie against
them, for the persuasion that they transgress the law of God,
inclines you not a little towards evil. Come then, let us
examine this matter. Christ said, Provide neilleer yold nor
silver, neither two θοαῖς, neither shoes, nor 9irdIe, nor yet
stares. What then ? tell me, did Peter transgress this com-
mand? Surely he did so, in having a girdle and a garment,
and shoes, for that he had them, listen to the words of the
Angel, Gz‘rd tlzyselss, and bima on thy sandals. And yet he
had no such great need of sandals, for at that season a man
may go even unshod3 their great use is in the winter, and yet
he had them. What shall we say of Paul, when he writes thus
to Timothy. Do thy (lilz'yenee to come before 'ze-inter? He
gives him orders too and sayS, Tlee elolre that I left at Troas
with Carpus bring] with thee, and the books, hut especially
the parclmzents. See he speaks of a cloke, and no one can
say that he had not another which he wore, sor if he did not
wear one at all, it were superfluous to order this one to be
brought, and if he could nothe without one to wear, it is
clear he had a second.

What shall we say of his remaining two whole year-s· in leis
own hired house ,9 Did then this chosen vessel disobey
Christ? this man who said, Ner-ertheless I lium yet not I,
