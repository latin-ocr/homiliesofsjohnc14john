11 sar surpasseth thee in its feathers ¹ and in its colour. The HOM-
swan too is passing fair, and many other birds, with whom if, XII'
thou art compared thou wilt see that thou art nought. Often ψῃ
100 worthless boys, and unmarried girls, and harlots, and
effeminate rnen have had this boast3 is this then a cause for (6)
arrogance? But art thou rich? NVhence so? what hast
thou? Gold, silver, precious stones! This is the boast of
robbers, of man-slayers, of those who work in the mines.
That which is the labour of criminals becomes to thee a
boast! But dost thou adorn and deck thyself out? Well, we
may see horses also decked out, and among the Persians
camels too, and for men, all such as are about the stage.
Art thou then not ashamed to boast thyself of these things, if
unreasoning animals, and slaves, and man-slayers, and
effeminate, and robbers, violaters of tombs, share with thee?

jackdaws dwell in more splendid houses, and have more
noble retreats. Dost thou not see how many, who were mad

feet? Again 1110 first prize is with unreasoning animals, the
hare, and the gazelle, and all the beastst which are not
wanting in swiftness of foot. Hast thou travelled much?
Not more than the birds, their transit is more easily made,
they have no need of provisions for the way, nor beasts of
burden, for their wings are all-sufficient for them; this is
their vessel, this their beast of burden, 11113 their car, this is
even their wind, in short, all that a man can name. But
art thou clear sighted? Not as the gazelle; not as the
eagle. Art thou quick of hearing? the ass is more so. Of
scent? the bound suffers 11100 1101 10 surpass him. Art thou
a good provider? yet thou art inferior to the ant. Dost thou
