A prisoner is in sear, when there is nothing beyond bonds:
but one that despiseth death, how should he be bound?
They did the same as if they had put in bonds the shadow
of Paul, and had gagged its mouth. For it was a fighting
with shadows3 for he was both more tenderly regretted by
his friends, and more reverenced by his enemios, as bearing
the prize for courage in his bonds. A crown bindsk the
head; but it disgraees it not, yea rather, it makes it bril-
liant. Against their wills they crowned him with his chain.
For, tell me, was it possible he could fear iron, who braved
the adamantino gates of death? Come we, belm-ed, to
emulate these bonds. As many of you women as decl< your-
selves with trinkets of gold, long ye sor the bonds of Paul.
Not so glitters the collar round your necks, as the grace of

'ff‘fflffl these iron bonds played about¹ his soul! If any longs for
those, let him hate these. For what communion hath sost-
ness with courage3 tricking out of the body with philosophy?
Those bonds Angels reverence, these they even make a mock
of 3 those bonds are wont to draw up from earth to heaven3
these bonds draw down to earth from heaven. For in truth
these are bonds, not those3 those are ornament, these are
bonds, these, along with the body, affliet the soul also;
those along with the body adorn as well the soul.

NVouldest thou be convinced that those are ornament?
Tell me which would more have won the notice of the
speetators? thou 01· Paul? And why do I say, ‘ thou?' the
queen herself who is all bedeeked with gold would not have
attracted the spectators so much 3 but if it had chanced that
both Paul in his bonds and tho queen had entered the
Chumh at the same time, all would have removed their eyes
from her to hi1n3 and with good reason. For to see a man
of a nature greater than human, and having nought of man,
but an angel upon earth, is more admirable than to see
a woman (lecked with finery. For such indeed one may
see both in theatres, and in pageants, and at baths, and
many places3 but whoso seeth a man with bonds upon him,
and docming himself to have the greatest of ornaments, and
