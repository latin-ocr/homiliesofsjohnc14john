58 Emamples of Humility, Conraye, Affeanness, Audacity.

PmL- committed nothiny ayainst the people, or cecstoms of our
2, 1'4‘fi117oer8, yet was J delivered pri-conerfrom Jerusalem.
'rhat these wore the words of humility, listen how he
v. Acts robukos them in what follows, Well spake the Holy most,
ῗξῇἕδῡῇ Hearing] ye shall hear, and shall not understand, and seeinq
ye shall see, and not perc-eive.
Seest thou his com-age? Behold also the courage of John
Mark tho Bapt'ust, which he used before Herod3 when he said, It is
5³22} not lamsulsor thee to have my brother· Philip's wffe. This
ther’s was bofflness, this was courage. But not so the words of
Z'Sa'm. Shimei, when he said, C'ome out, thou bloody man, and yet he
¹6² 7‘ too spake with boldness3 but this is not courage, but audacity,
and insolence‚ and an unbridled tongue. Jezebel too re-
proached J ehu, when she spoke of the slayer of his master¹‘‚
but this was audacity‚ not boldness. Elias too reproached‚
1 Kingsbut this was boldness and courage3 I have not troubled
18’ 18. Israel, but thou and tkyfatlzer's house. Again, Elias spake
ib. 21. with boldness to the whole people, saying, How lons] will ye
LXX. 90 lame on botla your tlzz‘ylzs .? Thus to rebuke was boldness
and courage. This too the prophets did, but that other was
audacity.
x*Vould you see words both of humility and of freedom1,
'listen to St. Paul, saying, But with me it is α very small
tlzz'ny that I should bey'ndyed of you, or os man'sjudyment;
yea, I J'udye not mine own sels. For I know nothiny by
{cm-,63 myself, yet am I not lcerebyjustz'fied. This is of a spirit that

becomes a Christian; and again, Dare any nyotc, leavz'ny a
matter ayainst another, yo to law before tlte unfus& and not
before tlte saints?

Would you see the flattery of the foolish Jews? listen to

J0¹ml92 them, saying, We leave no kz'ny but Ooesar. Would you see
{50'01‚4‚humility? listen to Paul again, when he says, For we

5· prena-la nol ozcrselves, but Olzrz‘st Jesus tlte Lord, and ourselves
your servants sor Jeszcs' salse. Would you soe flattery and

l Sam. audacity? Andaeity in the case of Nabal, and flattery in
'1252 10. that of the Ziphitos? How tho one redled, and how the other

{353¹}- in purpose betrayed David? Would you see tho wisdom of

IGSam. David, which was not flattery, how he gat Saul into his power,
ῗῗί 5 ¹¹ 2 Kings 9, 31. Harl Zimripeace ¹ SaV. in text. ‘ of servil}ty‚’ which
wlco slew his master f? does not suit the neoel quotatmu so well.
