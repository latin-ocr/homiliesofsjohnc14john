HOMILY III.

⁴2 Tflnss. i. 9, 10.

Wlao shall be pzmz'slcecl 1οίίή everlasle'ny destruction from tlte
presence os tlze Lord, anclsrom tlze ylory (gf He's pelvem·
leen He shall come to be ylorified in His saints, and to
be admired in all them that believe.

THERE are many men, who form good hopes not by
abstaining from their sins, but by thinking that hell is
not so terrible as it is said to be, but milder than what is
threatened, and temporary, not eternal3 and about this they
philosophise 11111011. Β111 Ι could shew from many reasons,
and conclude fron] the very expressions eoneerning hell, that
it is not only not milder, but much more terrible than is
threatened. But I (lo not now intend to diseourse 0011-
cerning these things. For the sear even froin bare words
is sufficient, though we do not fully unfold their meaning.
But that it is not temporary, hear Paul now saying, con-
cerning those who know not God, and do not believe in
the Gospel, that they shall be flami->fied wille everlaslessnffl
destruction. How then 13 that teinporary which is ever-
lasting? From tlze presence cffllae Lord, he says. W hat is
this? He wishes 10 say how easily it might be. For since
they were tben much puffed up at being rich, there is no
need, he says, os much trouble3 it is enough that (iod
comes and 13 36611, and all are involved in punishment
and vengeance. His coming to some indeed will be Light,

but to others vengeance.
