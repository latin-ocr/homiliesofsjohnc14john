labour. For tell me, when many things arc stirred up that
would draw us from love, and we hold out against them all, is
it not labour? For what did not these men suffer, that they
might not revolt from their love ? Did not they that warred on
the Gospcl¹ go to Paul's host, and not having found him,
drag Jason before the rulers of the city? Tell me, is this
a slight labour, when the seed had not yet taken root, to
endure so great a storm, so many trials ? And they demanded
security of him. And having given security, (he says,) J ason
sent away Paul. Is this a small thing, tell me? Did not
Jason even expose himself to danger for him? and this he
calls a labour of love, because they were thus bound to him.

And observet first he mentions their good actions, then
his own, that he may not seem to boast, nor to love them by
anticipation i. And patience, he says. For that persecution
was not confined to one time, but was continual, and they
waired not only with Paul, the master, but with his disciples
also. For if they were thus affected towards those who
wrought miracles, those venerable men3 what think you
were their feelings towards those who dwelt among them,
their fellow-citizens, who had all of a sudden revolted from
them? VVherefore this also he testifies of them, saying, For
ye became sollozvers of the Oh-urehes (ff θοαί which are in
Judaea.

And of hope, he says, in our Lora? Jesus Christ, in the
Seythf Gocl (md (mr Father. He hath well spoken thus.
For all these things proceed from saith and hope, so that
what happened to them shewed not their fortitude only, but
that they believed with full assurance in the rewards laid up
for them. For on this account God permitted that perseeutions
should arise immediately, that no one might say, that the
Proclamation was established lightly or by flattery, and that
their fervour might be shewn, and that it was not human
persuasion, but the power of God, that persuaded the souls
of the believers, so that they were prepared even for ten
thousand deaths, which would not have been the case, if the
Proclamation had not immediately been deeply fixed and
remained unshaken.
