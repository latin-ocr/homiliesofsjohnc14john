pavement of a king's house is always full of blood, the blood
of his own relations. But if ΥΟ will, I will relate some
instanccs, and ye will prescntly know that so it is. Iwill
chiefly relate those of older date, but which are still kept in
memory, as having happened in our own time. One⁸‚ it is
said, having suspected his wife of adultery, bound her naked
upon mules, and exposed her to wild beasts, though she had
already been the mother to him of many princes. What sort
of life, think yc, could that man have lived? For he would
not have broken out into such vengeance, had he not been
deeply affected with that distress. Moreover, thc same man
slew his own son ¹¹, or rather his brother slew himself, together
with his children, but he is also reported to have slain his
own brother. And the one indeed slew himself, when seized
by a rebel, and another put to death his cousin, his colleague

in the kingdom, to which he had appointed him.

r After these words the Greek text
is disarranged, and irreconcileable with
itself and with the real history. Chry-
sostom seems however to intend to say
what follows; that the brother of Cris-
pus, i. e. Constantius Augustus, caused
his father’s brother, Julius Constantius,
and his⁸sons, Dalmatius and Anniba-
lianus, to be put to death. They were
in fact slain by the soldiery, and as some
thought at the instigation of Constan-
tius Augustus, son of Constantine. He
adds afterwards, that his brother was
taken by an usurper, and killed himself.
Now Constans Augustus. the brother
of Constantius, was taken by the
usurper Magnentius, or rather by his
generals, and slaiu, but no writer ex-
cept Chrysostom says that he killed
himself. He adds that Constantius
slew his cousin. This was Gallus,
who was made his colleague in the Em-
pire by Constantius, and put to death
by his order, A.D. 345. Mmztf.

(Tillemont understands this other-
wise, and inore according to the Greek,
which is not difficolt to construe as it
stands; viz. that Constans killed him-
self and his children, [if he had any,
which does not otherwise appear,] when
taken by Magnentius, and that he
[Constans] caused the death of his
brother Constantine the younger.)

violent deaths that had occurred within
memory in the imperial palace ς he

goes, however, by common report, which
usually varies from the real fact. He
mentions the events without the names.
There is no doubt, however, that the
first example brought forward is Con·
stantiae the Great, who caused his son
Crispus to be put to death, and after-
wards his wife Fausta. Chrysostom
says he exposed her to wild beasts,
others however relate that she was
suffocated by his order in a hot bath.
Tillemont gives the most accurate of all
the accounts of this affair. Montf.

ἱ As for what Chrysostom adds, (as
usual without names,) of the wife of
one of the Augusti who used drugs to
cure barrenness, and perished together
with the woman who supplied the drugs,
also of another Augustus who was
poisoned, and whose son had an·eye
put out, and another who perished in
some horrible manner, I have not yet
been able to find out to whom it applies.
But what follows, of one burnt among
beams and horses and all sorts of
things, relates to Valens, who after
his defeat at Hadrianople retired to a
house, and was burnt to ashes with it.
The reigning Emperor was Arcadius,
with respect to whom the history of
that age attests the truth of his words.

'sillemont understands the one poi-
soned to be Jovian. and says that his
son Varronianus was treated as here
mentioned, and afterwards put to death3
