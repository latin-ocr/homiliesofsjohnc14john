wrestle with one another: if the Peace of God stand as HOM-
umpire, it bestows the prize on that which bids endure, and VIII.
puts the other to 31131116. How? by persuading him that

God is Peace, that He 113111 made peace with us. Not with-

out reason he shews the great struggle there is in the
matter. Let not anger, he saith, act as umpire, let not con-
tentiousness, let not human peace, sor human peace cometh

of avenging, of suffering no ill. But not this do I intend,

he saith, but that which Christ Himself lest.

He bath represented an arena¹ within, in the tl1oughts,¹ma10„.
and a contest, and a wrestling, and 311 umpire. Thcn again,
exhortation, to the which sese me callecl⁰ ,he saith, 11131 13, for 2 Gr
the which3 ye were called. He has leminded them of how 227in
many good things peace is the cause3 on account of this Hes ,Μ
63116(1 11166, for this He called thee, so as to receive a worthym
prize. For wherefore made He us one body? W'as it not
that she might rule ? lVas it not that we might have occasion
of being at peace? Wherefore are we all one body? and how
are we one body? Because of peace we are one body, and
because we are one body, we are at peace. But why said
he not, ‘ Let the peace of God be victorious,' but be unzpire?

He made her the more honourable ⁴. He would not have the ⁴ ἀξιοπι-
evil thought to come to wrestle with her, but to stand below. ⁹⁷⁰⁷²3“⁹·

besides, the other was aware that, perform what feats he
might, he should not receive the prize; however he might

puff, and attempt still more vehement onsets, he should

have to desist as labouring without profit. And he well
added, And be ye tlzaozkfecl, and very movinglyn. For this is

to be thankful, to deal with his fellowservants as God doth

with himself, to submit himself to the Master, to obey3 to
express his gratitude for all things, even though one insult

him, or beat him.
