degeneracy, and loss is here, he says, whilst IIc remained
what IIe was, lle took 11131 which He was 1101, 311(1 being
made ssesh He rcmained God, in that He was the lVord.

In this then He was like man, and sor this cause Paul
says, and Insaslzion, not to say that His nature dcgenerated,
or that any confusion was here, but He became man in
sashionh. For when he had said that He took tlte form Q]
(1 serrant, 110 1113(10 110111ἰ 10 say this 3180, sceing that the
first would silence all objectors; since whcn 110 says, In the
lia-eneas (gf silgfalfleslz, he says not that He had not flcsh,
11111 11131 11131 flesh sinned 1101, 11111 was like to sinsul flesh.
Like in what? in nature, not in sin, therefore was His like 3
sinful soul. As then in the former case he speaks of simi-
larity, because He was not equal 111 every thing, as His not
being born of wedlock, His being without sin, His being 1101
3 mere man, he wel] said as α man, sor He was not one of
the many, 11111 as 011Θ of the many. The lVord who was
God did 1101 degenerate into man, nor was His substance
changed, but he appeared as a man 3 not to delude 118 with a
phantom, but 10 instruct us in humility. then therefore he
sayS, ans· a man, this is what he means, since He calls Him a
Man elsewhere also, when he says, there is one Gocl, and
one IlIediator between Gocl and men, the Man Christ JeSuS.

Thus much against these heretics. I must now speak
against such as deny that He took a soul¹''; if the form (gf God
is “ perfect Goc ,” then 1110 form os (ι servant is ‘⁶ a perfect
servant.'' A gain our argument turns against the Arians. Beinq
in thesorm of Goel, it is written, He (hozzgylzt it not robbery
to be equal willa Gocl. We (10 1101 find ‘⁶ He became,” “ He
took,'' concerning His divinity, but He emplz'ecl He'mself,
cassius] the form of a servant, being] made in the [ὦρνιθες of
mem· concerning his humanity we find He took, He became.
He became the latter. He took the latter. He was the
former. Let us not then confound nor divide the natures.
There is one God‚ there is one Christ, the Son of God3 when
I say “ One,’' I mean a union, not a confusion, the one Nature
did not (lcgenerate into the other, but was united with it.
