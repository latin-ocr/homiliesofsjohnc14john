St. Paul's prayerfor temporal thinys α condescension. 173

shall have a reward, is we rejoice for their sake. Thus HOM-⁷

we shall not take it hardly, when men do not give, but XV.

rather shall grieve for their sake. So shall we render 1110111

111010 20310115, if we teach them, that not for our own

sake do we so act3 but my God shall supply all your

need, or all grace, or all joyl. If the second be truc,¹x02e¹23.

all yrclee, he meaneth not only the 311115, which are of earth,⁰¹'7⁶“3⁰‘”'

but every excellency. If the first, all your need, which I

think too should rather be read, this is what he means to

shew. As 110 had said before, yse lach-ecl opportunity, he here

maketh an addition, as he doth in 1110 Epistle to 1110 Corin-

thians, saying, Now He that minz’steretk seed to tlze 3000739001· 9,

bocla minister breadfor your sood, and rmcltiply your seed¹⁰'

sown, ancl increase llzefrm'ls os your rzffteousness. For he

blesseth them, that they may abound, and have wherewith to

sow. He blesseth 1110111 100, 1101 simply that they might

abound, but aceorclz‘rzy lo His makes, so that this too is done

measuredly. For had they 110011 35 110 was, so truly wise, so

crucified, he would not have done this3 but since they were

111011 11131 were handicraftsmen, poor, having wives, bringing

up children, ruling their families, and who had given these

very gifts out of small possessions, and had certain (1051105 of

the things of 11115 world, he blesseth them with a condescen-

sion. For it 15 1101 unseemly to pray for sufficiency and

plenty for 111050 who thus 1150 1110111. Ηο said not, May He

make you rich, and to abonnd great1y3 but what said he?

Supply all your need, so that ye may not be in want, but

have things for your necessities. Since Christ too, when

He gave us a form of prayer, inserted also this in the prayer,

when He taught us to say, Give us this day our claily &att-62

broad. ‘
Aca-ordino to His riclzes. What meaneth this? Accord-

ing to His free gist, i. e. It is easy 10 Η1111, 311(1 Ηο

1111111 power 10 <lo it quickly too. And since I have spoken

of need, he addcth, according) 10 His refelaes iu (llory by

Cleo-ist Jesus, that they may not think that 110 will (111νο

111011111110 5113115. So shall all things abound to you, saith

110,11131 you may have them 10 Η15 glory3 or he ineaneth

this, Ye are wanting in nothing, (for it is written, qreac qrace Acts 4,
