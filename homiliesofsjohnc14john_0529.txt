prophet saying, Do tlte slaeplaercls seed themselves .? F IV.

Do you observe Paul constantly seeking these prayers?Er2Z¹1{¹
Do you hear that thus Peter was delivered from prison, when {24²5}
fervent prayer was made for him? I verily believe that your Actsilb,
prayer will have great effect, offered with so great unanimity. 5.
Do you not think that it is a matter much too great for our
littleness to draw nigh to G od, and intreat Him for so numerous
a people? For if I have not confidence to pray for myseff,
much less sor others. For it belongs to men of high estimation,
to beseech God to be merciful to others3 it is for those who
have rendered Him favourable to themselves But he who
is himself an offender, how shall he intreat for another? But
nevertheless, because I embrace you with the bowels of a
father, because love dares every thing, not only in the
Clmrch, but in the house also, Ι make my prayer above all
other things for your health both in soul and in body. For
there is no other prayer so becoming to a Priest, as to draw
nigh to God and intreat Him for the good of the people,
before his own. For if J ob rising up immediately made so
many offerings for his children in the flesh, how much more
ought we to do this for our spiritual children?

And why do I say these things? Because if we, who are (4)

so far removed from the greatness of the work, offer suppli-
cations and prayers for you, much more is it just that you
also should do it. For that one should intreat for many, is
exceedingly bold, and requires much confidencc1: but that¹ παρρη-
many having met together should offer supplication for one, σίας·
is nothing burdensome. F or every one does this not trustin g
to his own virtue, but to the multitude, and to their unanimity,
to which God every where has much respect. For, He says,
where two or three core yatloered loyellzer in My Name, there Mamo,
am I in tlte millet of them. Ifwhere two 01· three are gathered ¹3·
together, He is in tho midst, much moro is He among you.
For that which a man praying by himselfis not able to receive,
that he shall receive praying with amultitude. Why? Because
although his own virtue has not, yet the common consenthas
much power.
