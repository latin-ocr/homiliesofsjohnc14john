1 Tuus. account He so cometh as a thies in the night ; that we may
5, 3'3not abandon oursclves to wickedncss, nor to sloth; that He
may not take from ns our reward. For yozcrselves know
perfec-Cly, he says. Why then are you carious, if you are
persuaded? But that the future is uncertain, learn from what
Christ has said. And that on this account He said it, hear

Matt. what He said, Watch therefore, sor ye know not 'et-hat hom·

2T4tz⁷ 84ξῶ the thief doth come. On this account also Paul said,

ofMan. Ver. 3. For when they shall say peace and safety; then

sudden. destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a
woman with child, and they shall not escape.

Here he has glanced at that which he has also said in his
second Epistle. For since they indeed were in affliction,
but they that warred on them at ease and in luxury, and
then while he comforted them in their present sufferings by
the mention of the Resurrection, the others insulted them
with arguments taken from their forefathers‚ and said, then

Is.5‚19. will it happen? Which the Prophets also said, VVoe unto

them that say, Let him mah-e speed, and hasten his ecorlc, that
we may see z't: and let the comesel of the Holy One of
Israel εἰν-(κη) «111911 and come, that we may know it. And
Amos 5, again, Woe anto them that desire the clay os the Lorcl. (For
18. he does not speak of those who simply desire it, but os those
who desire it because they disbelieve it. And the day ofthe
Lord, he says, is darkness, ancl not le'yht.) It is on this
account that hc so speaks. And sce how he consoles them,
ο as if lie had said, Let then] not account their being in a
prosperous state, a proof that thc Judgmcnt is not coming.

For so it is that it will come.

But it inay bc worth while to ask, If Antichrist comes, and
Elias coines, how is it when they say Pence, that a sudden
destruction comes upon thoni? For these things do not
permit thcin to be ignorant os the day, being signs of its
coming. But he does not allude to this period, Ι mean that
of Antichrist, nor does he speak of that (lay, because it will

¹0r‘that‘bo a sign of the coming of Christ3 but because¹ Christ will

not have a sign, but will come suddenly and unexpectedly‘.
For travail, indeed, you say, does not come upon tho pregnant

 

f Commel. 13. L. and Musc. read, because that (L. he) will bea sign of
‘ But he does not mean this to be the the coming os Christ, but Himself will
time of Antichrist, and the whole day, have no sign, hut, &c.'
