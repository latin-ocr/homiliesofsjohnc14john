with his trophies, with his inrmmerahle hands of soldiers, all
adorned with gold, with his spear-men, his body-guard,
bearing golden shields, whilst the whole city was adorned
with erowns, whilst all the rulers of the world accompanied
Him, and all the manhood os foreign nations followed Him,
prisoners, praeseets, 53113115, consuls, 111-31115, rulers. Then
should he in all this pomp 1666116 1116 citizens who meet
him, and embrace them, and streteh forth his hand, and give
them sreedom of access, 311(1 even converse with them, all
standing around, as with friends, and tell them that all that
journey was undertaken for their sake, and should then lead
one party into his palace, and should leave the other behind,

power not to be deprived of it. For this is 1116 misery, that
we suffer these things, when it is 111 our power not to suffer
them. For when He receiveth the one part to His Father in
heaven, and rejecteth the other, whom Angels take and drag
against their will, weeping, and hanging down their headS, to
the sire os hell, when they have first been made a spectacle
to the whole world, what grief, think you, is there? Let us
then make haste, while there is time, aud take great thought
of our own 5311311011. How many things have we 10 say like
the rich man? If any one would now suffer us, we would
take counsel of tho things that are profitable! But no one
