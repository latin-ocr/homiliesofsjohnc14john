How to use all tleinqssor God. 1:25

Never then let us flee from poverty as an evil, for it is 'the Hom.
procurer of heaven. Again, let us never follow riches as a X’
good, for they are the ruin of such as walk unwan'ly‚ but,

 

in every thing directing our eyes to God, let US, as occasion
requires, use those gifts which He has vouchsafed US, both
strength of limbs, and abundance of money, and every other

gift3 for it is unnatural that we, who have our being from Him,
should make these things serviceable to others, yet not to
Him, Who has made us. He formed thine eyes: make them
serviceable to Him, not to the devil. But how serviceable

to Him? By contemplating His creatures and glorifying
Him, and by withdrawing them from all gaze at women.

But thine hands did He make ? Preserve them for His use,

not for the devil, not putting them out for robbery and rapine,

but for His commandments and for good deeds, for earnest
prayers, sor holding out help to the fallen. Hath He made
thine ears ? Give these to Him, and not to effeminatem strains

nor to disgraceful tales. Lel all thy commemication, he says, Ecelus.
be in the lam Qfllte Most Hiyh. And again he says, Stand {²353}
‘m the multitude qftlte elders, and cleave mtto him that is ⁰ ' ”
wise. Has He made thy mouth? Let it do nought that is
‹lispleasing to Him, but sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual
songs. Let 720 corrupt eommmzicatz'on proeeed out qf your Eph. 4,
mouth, says the Apostle‚ but tlzat which, is yoodfor tlte use Qf29.
θάψ’-γίνῃ, ίΙιαί it may minister yraee to the hearers ; for
edification and not for subversion, for fair words and not for

evil speaking and plotting against other, but the very opposite.

He hath made thy feet, not that thou shouldest run to do

evil, but to do good. He made thy belly, not that thou
shouldest cram it to bursting,but to practise Iessons of wisdom.

For the productiori of children, He implanted desire in thy
mind, not for fornication, nor for adultery. He gave thee
undeistanding, not to make of thee a blasphemer or a reviler,

but that thou mightest speak fair words. He gave us both
money to be used on fitting occasion, and strength likewise

to be used on fitting occasion. He instituted arts, that our
present state of existence might be held together by them,

not that we should withdraw ourselves from spiritual things,
