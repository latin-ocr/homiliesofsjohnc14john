it was needsul that those also should hear. And they would

4‚17.18. have the greater advantage (11ν recognising their own errors

in the charges brought against others.

And that ye lilrewise read the Epistle from Laodieea. Some
say that this is not Paul’s to them, but theirs to Paul, for he said
not that to the Laodiceans, but that wn'ttensrom Laodicea.

Ver. 17. And say to Archippus, Talce lzeecl to the mini-stry
which thou least received in tlze Lorcl, tlzat thou sulfil it.
Wherefore doth he not write to him? Perhaps he needed it
not, but only a bare reminding, So as to be inore diligent.

Ver. 18. lee salutation by tlte fiand of me, Paul. This
is a proof of their sincerity and affec-tion3 that they both
looked at his handwriting, and that with emotion. Re-
member my bonas. Wonderful! How great the consolation!
For this is enough to eheer them on to all things, and make
them bear themselves more nobly in their trials3 but he
made them not only the braver, but also the more nearly
interested. Grac-e be with you. Amen.

Itis great praise, and greater than all the rest, his saying
of Epaphras, wlzo is [one] (ff you, a servant of Christ. And
he ealleth him a minister sor them, like as he termeth himself

‚ also a minister of the Chureh, as when he saith, W'lzereof

I Paul am made a minister. To the same dignity 116 ad-

, · vances this man 3 and above 116 calleth him a sellom-servant,

and here, a servant. leo is of you, he saith, as if speaking to
a mother, and saying, ‘ who is of thy womb.’ But this praise
might have gendered envy3 therefore he commendeth him
not from these things only, but also from what had regard to
themselves; and so he does away with envy, both in the
former place, and here. Always, he saith, striviny sor you,
not now only, whilst with us, to make a display 3 nor yet only
whilst with you, to make a display before you. By saying,
Striviny, he hath shewed his great earnestness. Then‚
that he might not seem to be flattering them, he added, tlzat
ke laath a yreat zeal for you, and sor them tlzat are iu
Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis, And the words, that ye
may stand perfect, are not words of fiattery, but of a reverend
Master. Both complete, he saith, and perfect. The one he
granted them, the other he said was lacking. And he
said not, ‘ that ye be not shaken,' but, that ye may stand.
