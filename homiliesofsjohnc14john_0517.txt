Fire ofSpirit czares tlte soil. The riclt promi in Clzurclz. 487

grows 111 places that are precipitous, stony, and dry, where HOM-
there is no moisture. then therefore any 0116 15 rough and -AEI—
precipitous, that is unmerciful, the thorn grows in him. But
where the sons of the husbandmen wish to root them up,

they do it not with iron. How then? Having set fire to it,

Α they in that way extract all the bad quality of the land.

For since it is not enough to cut away the upper part,
whilst the root remains below, nor even to extirpate the root,

(for it remains in the earth from its bad quality, and, as
when some pestilence has assailed the body, there are still

left the remains of it,) the fire from above, drawing up¹ all¹02uu05·
that moisture of the thornsc, like some poison, extracts it by “⁵⁹⁰''
means of the heat from the bowels of the earth. For as the
cupping glass2 placed upon the part draws all the disorder to2 σικύα
itself, so the fire draws off 311 the base quality that was 111 the
thorns, and makes the land pure.

On what account then do I say these things? Because it
behoves you to purge off all affection3 for 1161165. For with3 συμπή-
115 3150 there is a fire that draws this bad quality from the ΛΜ
soul3 I speak of that of the Spirit. This 1f we let work on
them, we shall be able not only to dry up the thorus, but
also the humour from them, since if they be deeply fixed, all
is rendered vain. For mark. Has a rich man entered here,
or even a rich woman? She does not regard how she shall
hear the oracles of God, but how she shall make a show,
how she shall sit with pomp, how with much glory, how she
shall surpass all other women in the costliness of her garments,
and render herself more dignified both by her dress, and look,
and gait. And all 1161· care and concern is, Did such a woman
see me? did she admire me? ls my beauty handsomely set
off? And not only about thisd does she care, but that her
garments may not rot, nor be rent; and about this is all her
care. In like manner also the rich man enters, meaning to
exhibit himself to the poor man, and to strike him with awe
by the garments which arc about him, and by the number of
his slaves. And they stand round, driving off the crowd.
