may see it, ancl let the σουπερὶ Qf the Holy One Qf Israel
come, that we may lmow it. Let us not wonder at this. For
neither did those believe who were in the days of the ark3
they believed, however, when their belief was of no gain to
them3 neither did they of Sodom expect [their sate]‚ howbeit
they too believed, when they gained nothing by belicving.
And why do I speak of the future? tho would have ex-
pected these things which are now happening in divers
places; these earthquakes, these overthrows of citios? And
yet were these things easier to believe than those ; those, I
mean, which happened in the days ot' the ark.

Whence is this evident? Because that the men of those
times had no other example to look at, neither had thoy heard
the Scriptures, but with us, on the other hand, are countless
instances that have happened both in our own, and in former
years. But whence arose the unbelief ofthese persons? From
a sostened soul; they drank and ate, and therefore they be—

who are without. Why receivest thou the Laver? thy
dost thou set feet within the Church ? Is it that we promise
thee magistracies? All our hope is in the things to come.
Why then comest thou, if thou believest not the Scriptures,
if thou believest not Christ? I cannot call such an one a
Christian3 God forbid! but worse than even a Gentile. In
what respect? In this3 that when thou thinkest Christ is
God, thou believest Him not as God. For in that impiety
there is at least consistency; sor he who thinks not that
Christ is God, necessarily will also not believe Him, but this
