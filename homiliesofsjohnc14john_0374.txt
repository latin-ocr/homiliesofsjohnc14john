thclcss Hc adds this also, Tleouyh Noah, Job, med Daniel
stood before Me. And perhaps He the rather says this to
him, because it is he who suffered so many things, Thou
badest 1110, 110 says, eat upon dung, and I ate upon 113. Τ11011
badest mc share my head, and l shaved it. Thou badess
me 110 1111011 0110 51(10, and Ι (11(1 11. Τ11011 badest me go out
through a holc 111 1110 wall, bearing a burden, and 1 went out.

Thou tookest away my wife, and badest me not mourn, and ⁸

I did not mourn, but bore it with fortitude. Ten thousand
011101 things have Ι done for them: and I entreat for them,
and dost Thou not eomply ? G-od therefore, shewing that it is
not from despising him that He does this, says, Though
Noah, Job, and Daniel were there, and should intreat for
their sons and daughters, I would not comply.

And again to Jeremiah, who had suffered less from the
eommandments of God, but more from their wickedness,
what does He say? See-st thou not what they do? ‘ Yea,’
he says, ‘ they do so——but do Thou do it for my sake ' On
this account He says 10 111111, Thou-qh Illoses and Samuel stood
before Me. Moses, their first lawgiver, who often delivered
them from dangers, who had said, Is now mozoforqivest
their εἰη, soryz've it; bnt zf not, blot me out also. If there-
sore he were now alive, and spoke thus, he would not pre-
vail‚—nor would Samuel, again, who himself also delivered
them, and who from his earliest youth was admired. For to
the former indeed Ι said, that I conversed with him as a
friend with a friend, and not by dark sayings. And of the
latter I said, that in his first youth I was revealed to him,
and that on his account, being prevailed upon, l opened the
prophccy that had been shut up. For the ‘word Os the Lord,
it is said, was precious in those (lczys‚· there was 920 open
vision. If these men, therefore, stood before Me, they would
profit nothing. And of Noah He says, Noalz was a sust
man, and pepsect in lais yenemle'on. And concerning Job,
He was blanzeless, Just, true,jea2·z'ny Gocl. These then, had
they stood before nim, and Daniel, whom the Chaldeans
even thought a god, they would not be able, He said, to
delirer their sons and daughters. Knowing· these things,
