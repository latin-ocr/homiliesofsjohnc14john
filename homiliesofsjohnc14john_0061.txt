mindedness of this blessed One3 he was stiriing in the contest,

he had done ten thousand exploits, 116 was now close to his

crown, he was Paul, and what can one add to this? still he

writes to the Philippians, Ι may be saved tkrouylz your

prayer, I who have gained salvation through countless

achievements. And the supply, saith he, of the Spe-it of

Jesus Clo-ist. What means he by this supply ,9 it is as though

he said, if I am thought worthy of grace through your praycrs.

For the meaning of supply is this, may the spirit be supplied

to me, be given to me more abundantly, unto salvation,

that is, to deliverance, that I may escape the present as I did

the f01··me1 danger. Of this same matter he says, At my first2 Tim

answer 110 man stood wille me, but all 111611 foysoolc me; [4⁷ 16

to my earnes-t expectation, ancl my hope, for thus have I hope,

says he. For that he may persuade us not to leave the whole

matter to the prayers made for us ³, and contribute nothing

ourselves, behold how he lays down his own part, which is

Hope, the source of all good, as the Prophet says. Let tlzy Ps. 33,

morey, Ο Lorcl, be upon 113, cas ue leave hopecl in leee. 2²*

a thing it is to hope in God? WVhatever happens, he says, I

shall not be ashamed, i. e. they will not obtain the mastery

over 1116, but in all bolchoess, as always, 30 now also, Christ

shall bc> mccymfied 111 my body. They forsooth expected to

catch Paul in this snare, and to quench the preaching of the

Gospel, as though their craftiness were of any power. This

then, he says, shall not be so, I shall not now die, but as
