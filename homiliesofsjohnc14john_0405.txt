And this comes to pass out of great care on God‘s part.
How, and in what way? For the sake both of the Saints
themselves, and of those who believe in them. For as He
permits that there should be persecutions, so He permits that
they also should be ignorant of many things, that they may
be kept humble. On this account also Paul said, There 1003220οΓ-
yiven to me a thorn in tlze fleslz, the messenyer of Satan to ' '
bzffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. And
again, lest others also should have great imaginations con-
cerning them. Foris they thought they were gods from their
miracles, much more if they had continued always knowing
all things. And this again he also says: Lest any man Ib. 6,
should think of me above tlzat which lae seetlz me to be, or tlzat
ke bearem osme. And again hear Peter, when he healed
the lame man, saying, ley look ye 80 earnestly οη us, as Acts 3,
tlwuqlz by our own power Or holiness we laad made [levis man 12.
to walle. And if even when they were saying and doing these
things, from these few and small miracles, evil imaginations
were thus engendered, much more would they have been from

 

great ones.

But for another reason to these things were allowed. For
that no one might be able to say it was as being other than men
that they performed those excellent actions, and so all should
become supine, he shews that they also were subject to
infirmity, that he might cut off ¹ all pretext of impudence from 1 One
those who were willing to be undutiful. For this reason he Ms.
