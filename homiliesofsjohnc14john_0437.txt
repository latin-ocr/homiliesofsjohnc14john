Christians really sleep in death like Christ. 407

Where are they who deny¹ the Fleshb? Foris He did not ΙέοΜ.
assume Flesh, neither did He die. And is He did not die, Π·
neither did He rise again. How then does he exhort usq-u,
from these things to saith? XVas he not then according to
them a trifler and a deceiver? For if to die proceeds from
sin, and Christ did not sin, how does he now encourage us?

And wherefore does he also say, Even as others which have

no hope ἓ As if he had said, Ο men, for whom do yc mourn?

For whom do ye sorrow? sor sinners, or simply for the
dead? Therefore for whom do they mourn? But to them

all these things are vapid⁰. The firstborn from the (lead, Col. 1,
he says, that is, the first-fruits. Therefore there must also 18.
be others left. And see how here he introduces nothing
from reasonings, because they were docile. But in writing

to the Corintfflans, he first broached many things also from
reasonings, and then he added, T hou fool, that which thousscgrd
sowest is not quichened. For this is more authoritative, ’ ⁵
but it is when he converses with the faithful. But with

him who is without, what authority would this have d? Evetz

so, he says, them also which sleep in Jesus will Gocl bring]
with Him. Again, which sleep: he no where says, the dead.

But with respect to Christ, his words are, He died, because

he also spake of the Resurrection, but here of them which
sleep in Jesus, saying this, either that they slept in the faith

of Jesus, or that through Jesus will He bring them that

had fallen asleep, that is, the faithful. Here the heretics say,

that he is speaking of the baptized. What place then is
there for even So? For Jesus did not sleep by Baptism. But

on what account does he say, them which sleep? So that

he is discoursing not of the general Resurrection, but of a ’
particular one. Them which sleep in Jesus He will bring,

he says, and thus he speaks in many places.

Ver. 15. For this we say mtto you by the word (γ’ the Lord,
that we which are alive and remam emto the cominq Qf the

’ Lord, shallſjtot prevent them which are asleep.
