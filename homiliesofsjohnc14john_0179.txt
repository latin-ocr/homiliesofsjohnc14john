others their belly is their god, Are not these too idolaters,

and worse than the common? leose ylory, saith he, is in

their chame. Some say, that he points at the circumcision

in these words. Ι think not so, but this is its meaning, they

make a boast of those things, of which they ought to be
ashamed. As he saith in another place. leatsruit lead ye Rom. 6,

fearsul thing to do shameful actions, but to do them, and be
ashamed, is only half so dreadful. But where a man even
boasts himself of them, it is excessive senselessness.

Do these words apply to them alone? And do those who
are here present escape the charge ? And will no one have
account to render of these things? Does no one make
a god of his belly, or glory in his shame? I would wish,
earnestly would Ι wish, that none of these charges lay against

than to the men of those times. For when one consumes his
whole life in drinking and revelling, and expends some small
trifle on the poor, whilst he consumes the larger portion on
his belly, will not these words with justice apply to him? No (2)
words are more apt to call attention, or more cutting in re-
proof, than these, Whose qod is their belly, whose story is

on the earth again: let us obtain power3 again on the earth:
let us gain glory; again on the earth: let us enrich our-
selves3 all these things are on the earth. These are they,
whose god is their belly, for if they have no spiritual
thoughts, but have all their possessions here, and mind these
things, with reason have they their belly for their god, in
saying, Let us eat and drink,f0r to-morrow we die. And
then thou grievest about thy body, that it is of earth, though
this doth thee no injury in respect of virtue. But whilst thou
