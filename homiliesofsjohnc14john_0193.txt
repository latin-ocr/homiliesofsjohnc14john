standing, this maketh us near God3 nothing so much
delighteth God, as to remember no evil. This sets thee free

from thy sins, this looseth the charges against thee: but if

we are fighting and buffeting, we become far off from God:

for enmities are produced by contention, and from enmity
spring rancours.

Cut out the root, and there will be no fruit. Thus shall we
learn to despise the things of this lise, for there is no conten-
tion in spiritual things, but whatever thou seest, either conten-
tion, or envy, or whatever a man can mention, all these spring
from the things of this life. Every contentiori hath its
beginning either in covetousness, or envy, or vainglory. If
therefore we are at peace, we shall learn to despise the things
of the earth. Hath a man stolen our money? He hath not
injured us, only let him not steal oin· treasure which is above,
saith such an one. Hath he hindered thy glory ? Yet not
that which is from G-od, but that which is of no account.
For this is no glory, but a mere name of glory, or rather a
shame. Hath he stolen thy honour? Rather not thine but
his own. For as he who committeth injustice doth not so
much inflict as receive inj ustice, thus too he who plots
against his neighbour, first destroyeth himself.

selves. When we supplant the reputation of others, let us
consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves we
plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have
power, but ourselves in the sight of God, by provoking Him
against us. Let us not then injure ourselves. For as we
injure ourselves when we injure our neighbours, so by bene-
fitting them we benefit ourselves. If then thy enemy injure
thee, consider that he hath benefitted thee, if thou art wise,
and so requite him not with the same things, but even do
him good. But the blow you say remains severe. Consider
then that thou dost not benefit‚ but punishest him, and bene—
fittest thyself, and quickly you will come to do him good.
What then? Shall we act from this motive ? We ought not
to act on this motive, but if thy heart will not hear other
