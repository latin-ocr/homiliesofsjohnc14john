from that which is vile in appearance. And what, tell me, is
not the water that dcseends from above one thing, and how is
it changed into so many things? F or this is more wonderful
than the Resurrection. For there indeed the sanie seed and
the same plant is the subject, and there is a great affinity.
But here tell me how, having one quality and one nature, it
turns into so many things? For in the vinc it becomes wine,
and not only wine, but leaves and sap. For not only is the
cluster of grapes, but the rest of the vine nourishcd by it.
Again, in the olive, (it becomes) oil, and many other things,
too numerous to mention. And what is wonderful, here it is
meist, there dry, here sweet, there sour, here astringent, else-
where bitter. Tell me how it turns into so many things?
Shew me the reason ἱ But you cannot.

And in the case of thyself‚ tell me, for this comes nearer,
this seed, that is lodged in the won1b1, how is it formed and
moulded into so many things? how into eyes? how into
ears? how into hands? how into a heart? Are there not in
the body ten thousand differences of figures, of sizes, of
qualities, of positions, of powers, of proportions? How do
nerves and veins and flesh and bones and membr-anes, and
arteries and joints and cartilages, and as many more things
beside these, as the sons of the physicians precisely specify,
which compose our nature—how do these all come from
that one seed? Does not this then seem to you much more
difficult than those things? How is the moist and the soft
congealed into the hard and cold, that is, bone ? How into
thc warm and moist, which are united in the blood? How into
the cold and soft, the nervo ? How into the cold and moist, the
artery? Tell me, whence are these things? Dost thou not
questiong of these things? Dost thou not see every day a
resurrection anda death taking place in the periods of our
life? thither is our youth gone? whence is our age come?
how is it that he who is grown old cannot indeed make him-
self young, but begets another, a very young child, and what
he cannot give to himself, that he bestows upon another?

This also we may see in trees and in animals, and yet

Β The arteries were then thought to convey air through the body.
