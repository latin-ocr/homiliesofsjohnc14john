388 Allsornication and lust contrary to holiness.

lTffl·;s.commit it, how excessivo is the outrage! For tln‘s, he says,

424-{35 is tlee <ec-ill of God, eren your sateclificalz'on, that ye should

alt-stain from cell‘fornic-allon. For there are many {ornis of
irregularity. The pleasures of wantonness are of many kinds
and various, it were not tolerable to mention them. But
having said srom all sorm'eation, he leaves it to those who
know them.

Ver. 4, 5. Tleat every one ofyou should know how to possess
leis mss-al iu sanctific-alien and honour, Not in the last of
conc·eq)i.s·ceuc‹,›, even] as (he Gentiles which know not God.

He says, leat every one (gf you should know lzow to
possess lais vessel. It is, then, a matter to be learnt, and
that diligently, not to be wanton. But we possess our
vessel, when it remains pure and in sanctification: but
when it is impure, it is sin. For it no longer does the things
which we wish, but what sin commands. Not in tlte [ustos con-
cupiscenee, he says. Thero he shews also the manner, ac-
cording to which one ought to be temperate3 that we should
cut off the lusts of concupisconce. For luxury, and wealth
too, and idleness, and sloth, and ease, and all such things,
lead us on to irregular lust. Even as the Gentiles, he says,
wltz‘elz lmozc: not God. For such are they who do not expect
that they shall suffer punishment.

Ver. 6. leat 720 man 90 beyond ancl clefraudlzz’s brother in
any¹ matter.

He has well said, that no man 90 beyond. For to each
man God has assigned a wife, and has set bounds to nature,
that intercourse with one only: therefore intercourse with
another is transgression, and robbery, and the taking of more
than belongs to one ‘¹3 or rather it is more cruel than any
robbery3 sor we grieve not so much, when our riches are
carried off, as when marriage is invaded. Dost thou call
him brother, and detraudest him, and that in things which
art¹ unlawful ,Ρ llere he speaks concerning adultery, but above
also concerning all ser-meatim. For since he was about to
say, Thac m) man {jo beyond aad defraucl leis brother, antici-
pating, lest you should think, he says, that I say this only in
the case of bretlnen, yon must not have the wives of others
