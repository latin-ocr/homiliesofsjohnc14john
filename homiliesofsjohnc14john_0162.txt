3⁹ '⁴⁰' ness, for this must wc believe that He was able, but how He
was able we cannot prove. For from saith is the sellowship
os His sufferings. But how? IIad we not believed, neither
2Tim. should we have suffered: had we not believed, that {f we
' suffer with Him, we shall also reiyn with Him, we should
not have endured the sufferings. therefore both the gene-
ration and resurrection is comprehended by saith. Seest
thou, that saith must not be absolutely, but through good
works, sor he especially believes that Christ hath risen, who
in like sort gives himself up to dangers, who hath fellowship
with Him in His sufferings. For he hath fellowship with Him
Who rose again, with Him Who livetb3 wherefore he saith,

Therefore persecuti-ons, and afflietions, and straits, ought
not to disturb you, but even to make you glad, because
through them we are cotgfbrmed to His death. As if he had
said, We are moulded to His likeness3 as he says in another

2Cor.2‚place, where he writeth, bearing] about in the body the dyiny
