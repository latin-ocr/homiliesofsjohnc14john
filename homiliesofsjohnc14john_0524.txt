494 Christ tlte Love oftlce Trutlt. His bbrerzmners.

Ver. 10, 11, 12. Because tlzey received not tlte love of tlze
trutb, that they miylit be gat-ed. Audsor this cause God
shall send tlzem a stronq delusiwi, tlzat tliey should believe a
lie. Tliat they all misllzt be clamne& who believed not tlte
trutli, but bad pleasure in mzrz'ylateousness.

T hac they miqkt be jicdyedss. He does not say, that they
might be punished. For even without this they were about
to be punished, but tlzat they miqlzt be jzcdyed‚ that is, eon-
demned at that dreadful Seat of Judgment. But who are
these? He has himself interpreted, by adding, who believed
not tlte trutb, but hadpleasme in mzriybteousness. But he
calls Christ, tlte Leve qs the Trutlz. Because tlzey received
not the love Os tlte trutli. For He was both, and came for
the sake of both, both as loving men, and on behalf of things
that were true ‘¹.

But had plemam, he says, iu, unriylzteousness. For he
comes to the destruction of men, and to injure them. For
what will he not then work? He will change and confound
all things, both by his connnandments, and by the sear of
him. He will be terrible in ever)v way, from his power, srom
his cruelty‚ from his unlawful connnandmonts.

But fear not. Irz those tliat perisse, he says, hc will have
his etrengthe. For Elias too will then come to give confi-
dence to the faithful, and this Christ says3 Elias shall come
and restore all tbinqs. Ther-ofore it is said of John, In tlte
spirit and power Qf Elias. For ho neither wrought signs
nor wonders‚ as Elias did. For John, it is said, did πο
mirac-le, but all tlzinys which John spake of this Man were
true. How then was it in tlte spirit and power (ff Elias?
That is, he will take upon him the same ministry. As the
one was the forerunner of His first Coming, so will the other
be of His second and glorious Coming, and for this he is

‘'mm“ reserved. Let us not therefore sear. He has calmed³ the

minds os the hearers. He causes them no longor to think
present things dreadsul, but worthy os thankfulness. VVhere-
fore he has added,
