obedient, not being-’equal to Him Whom He obeyed. O
ye obstinate ones and unwise! This doth not at all lower
Him. For we too osttirnes become obedient to our friends,
yet this makes us not inferior. He became obedient willingly
as a Son to His Father; He fell not thus into a servile state,
but by this very act above all others guarded His wondrous
Sonship, by thus greatly honour-ing the Father. He honoured
the Father, not that thou shouldest dishonour Him, 11111 11131
thou shouldest the rather admire Him, and learn from this
act, that He is a true Son, in honouring His Father more
than all besides. No one 113111 111118 honoured God. As
was His height, such was the correspondent humiliation
which He underwent. As He is greater than all, and no one

death, yet they might from the manner of His death. For
this cause two robbers were crucified with Him, and He in
the midst, that He might share their ill repnte, and that the
Scripture might be sulfilled, And he was numbered with tlte Is. 53,

so much the more doth it become bright3 for when His
enemies plotted such things against His glory, and it yet

by slaying Him simply, but by slaying Him in such sort did
they think to make Him abominable, to prove Him more
abominable than all men, but they availed nothing. And
both the robbers also were such impious ones, (for it
