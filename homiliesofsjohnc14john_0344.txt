314 Euvy marles those whofaconr the saints as partakers.

See how great a thing is the not envying. The toil is
another's, the pleasure is thine; another wears the crown,
ans] thou caperest, thou art gay ¹. For tell me, seeing it is
another that bath conquered, why dost thou leap? But they
also know well, that what hath been done is common. There-
sore they do not accuse one's selsk indeed,but they try to beat
down the victory 3 and you hear them saying such words as
these, ‘ (There) I expunged thee,’ and, ‘ I beat thee down.'
Although the deed was another's, still the praise is thine.
But if in things without, not to envy, but to make another's
good one's own, is so great a good, much more so the
victory over the devil. For he then breathes the more furi-
ously against us, evidently because we are then more pleased.
Wicked though he is, he well kno‘ws that this pleasure is great.
Wouldest thou pain him ? Be glad and rejoice. Wouldest
thou gladden him ? Be sad-visaged. The pain he has from
thy brother's victory, thou soothest by thy sadness3 thou
standest with him, severed from thy brother, thou workest
greater mischief than he. For it is not the same for one that
is an enemy to do the deeds of an enemy, and for a friend to
stand with an enemy; such an one is more detestable than an
enemy. If thy brother have gained good reputation either
by speaking, or by brilliant¹ or successful achievement,
become thou a sharer in his reputation, shew that he is a
member of thine.

‘ And how?' saith οηε,ζ for the reputationis not mine.’ Never
speak so. Compress thy lips. If thou hadst been near me,
thou that speakest on that wiso, Ι would have even put my
hand over thy lips: lest perchance the enemy should hear
thee. Ostentimes we have enmities with one another, and
we discover them not to our enemies, but thou discoverest
thine to the devil. Say not so, think not so; but the very
reverse: ‘ he is one of my members, the glory passes on to
the body? ‘ How then is it,' saith one, ⁶ that those without are
not so minded ?’ Because of thy fault: when they see thee
counting his pleasure not thine own, they too count it not
thine: were they to see thee appropriating it, they durst not do
so, but thou wouldest become equally illustrious with him.

k τουπ-ᾧ, the partizan of the victor.
