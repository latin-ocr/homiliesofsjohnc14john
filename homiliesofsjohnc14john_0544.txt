21‘HES- Let us not therefore regard how we shall have wealth, but
3‚i7.18-. how we shall present with confidence to God the souls with
which we are entrusted. For by regulating them we shall
also most highly benefit ourselves. For hc who teaches
another, although he does nothing else, yet in speaking is
affected with colnpunetion, and especially when he sees
himself responsible for those things, on account of which he
reprovcs others. Since therefore we benefit both ourselves
and them, and through them the household, and this is
preeminently plcasing to God3 lct us not be weary of taking
care both of our own souls, and of those who minister to us,
that sor all we may receive a recompence, and with much
riches may arrive at the holy City our mother, the Jerusalem
that is above, from which God grant that we may never sall,
but that having shone in the most excellent conversation,
we may be. thought worthy with much confidence to see our
Lord J esus Christ3 with Whom to the Father, together with

the Holy Ghost, he glory, power, and honour, now and ever,
and world without end. Amen.
