another far greater King. Truly a confirmation ef tlte
Gospel were his bonds. See how he more than succeeded
in turning all things to their opposite. For what they
supposed to be a weakness and a detraction, that he calls a
confirmation3 and had this not taken place, there had been a
weakness. Then he shews that his love was notos prejudice,
but ofjudgment. Why? Ι have you (in my heart), he says,
in my bonds, and in my defence, because of your being
partakers qs* my yrace. What is this? W as this the yrcwe of

Wherefore, saith he, I take pleasure in hfirmities, in
reproaches. Since then Ι see you in your actions giving
proof of your virtue, and being partakers of this grace, and
that with readiness, I reasonably suppose thus much. For I

from us, ye strive not to be wanting to us in our troubles,
but to partake in our trials for the Gospel's sake, and to take
no less share than inyself, who am engaged in the combat,
far off as ye are3 am doing but justice in witnessing to these
things.

be a sellom-pa7·lalcer¹‘ of the Gospel, that is, that I may
share in the good things laid up for the Gospel¹. And
the wonder indeed is, that they were all so minded as to be
called sellow-partctkers with Paul, for he says that ye all
are sellow-parlakers of my yrczee. From these beginnings,
then, I am confident, that such ye will be even to the end.
For it cannot be that so bright a commencement should be
quenched, and fail, but it points to¹¹¹ great results.
