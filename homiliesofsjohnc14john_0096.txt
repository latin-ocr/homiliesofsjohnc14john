of wrong he sets H imself as an example, Learn of slIe,for J
am meelc and lowly in heare. And again, If I your Lord
and Master do these tldnqs, how much more should ye?
Seest thou how these examples are not distant ⁰, for there is
no need they should be so distant, for indeed we also do
these things, especially asin this case the example is not even
near. And how? If lIe be a servant, He is inferior, and
subject to Him that is greater3 but this is not lowliness of
mind. It was requisite to shew the contrary, namely, that
the greater person subjected himself to the lesser. But since
he found not this distinction, between greater and lesser I
mean, in God, he made at least an equality. Now if the
Son were inferior, this were not a sufficient example to lead
us to humility. And why? because it is not humility, for
the lesser not to rise against the greater, not to snatch at
rule, and to be obedient ‘emto death.

A gain, consider what he says aster the example, In lowlz'-
wess of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
He says, esleem, for as ye are one in substance, and in the
honour which cometh of God, it follows that the matter is
one of estimation. Now in the case of those who are greater
and lesser, he would not have said esleem, but honour them
that are better than yourselves, as he says in another place,
Obey them that have the recle over you, and submit your-
selves. In that instance subiection is the result os the nature
of the case, in this of our own estimation. In Zowlc'ness of
mind, he says, let each esteem other better than themselves,
as Chn'st also did.

Thus are their explanations overthrown. It remains
that I speak of our own aster I have first spoken of them
summarily. then exhorting to lowliness of mind, Paul
would never have brought forward a lesser one, as obedient
to a greater. Is he were exhorting servants to obey their
