powerful as the F ather, this is a proos os the Father's
power. then Ι say that He is good as the Father,
this is the greatest evidence of His goodness, that He
begat such (a Son), in no whit less or inferior to Himself.
When I say that Ho begat Him not inferior in substance
but cquaL and not of another substance, in this I again
wonder at G0d‚ His power, and goodness, and wisdom, that
He hath manifested to us Another, of Himselst such as Him-
self, except in His not being tho Father. Thus whatsoever
great things I say of the Son, pass on to the Fathcr. Now if
this small and light matter (for it is but a light thing to God's
glory that the world should worship Him) is to the glory of
God, how much more so are all those other things?

Let us then believe to His glory, let us live to His glory,
for one is no use without the other; when we glorify Him
rightly, but live not rightly, then do we especially insult
Him, because wc are enrolled under Him as a Master and
Teacher, and yet despise Him, and stand in no dread of His
fearful judgment seat. It is no wonder that the heathen live
impurely. This merits not such condemnation. But that
Christians‚ who partake in such great mysteries, who enjoy
so great glory, that they should live thus impurely, this is
worst of all, and unbearable. For consider Ρ, Η6 was
obedient to the uttermost, wherefore He received the honour
which is on high. He became a servant, wherefore He is
Lord of all, both of AngeIS, and of all other. Let us too not
suppose then that we descend from what is our (lue, when
we humble ourselves. For thus in all likelihood may we be
more highly exalted3 then do we especially become admirable.
For that the lofty man is really low, and that the lowly man
is exalted, the sentence of Christ sufficiently declares. Let
us however examino the matter itself. that is it to be
hnmbled ? Is it not to be blamed, to bc accused, and calum-
niated? that is it to be exalted? Is it not to bo honoured,
to be praised, to be glorified? Well. Let us 566 how the
matter is. Satan was an angel, he exalted himself. that
then? was he not humbled beyond all other? has he not the
earth as his place? is he not condemned and accused by all?
Paul was a man, and humbled himself. What then? is he
