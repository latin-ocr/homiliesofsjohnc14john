Thus God has not called us for this endg that He might
destroy uS, but that Hc might save us. And whence is it
manifest that this is His will? He has given His own Son
for us, he says. So does He desire that we should be saved,
that He has given His Son, and not merely given, but given
Him to death. From these considerations hope is begotten.
For do not despair, O man, in going to God, tho has
not spared even His own Son for thee. Faint not at
present evils. He who gave His Only-Begotten, that He
might save thee and deliver thee from hell, what will He sparc
henceforth sor thy salvation? So that thou oughtest to hope
for all things favourable. For neither should we sear, if we
were going to ajudge who was about to judge US, and who
had shewn so much love for us, as to have sacrificed his son.
Let us hope therefore for good and great things. For we
have received the principal thing, if we believe. For we
have seen an example. Let us love, for it is the extreme of
madness for one not to love who has been so treated.

And again ¹¹, whether we wake or sleep ; but by sleep there
he means one thing, and here another. For here it signifies
the death os the body, but there negligence in our course of
life. What therefore he means is this. Fear not dangers;
though we should die, we shall live. Do not despair because
thou art in danger. Thou hasta strong seeurity. He would
