once comfort, and exhortation, and encouragement to them. Hom,
For if He raised Him from the dead, and He is in heaven, ῙῙ·
and thence will come, (and that it is so, ye believed3 for if

ye had not believed it, ye would not have suffered so much,)

this of itself is sufficient comfort. And if they also shall
suffer punishment, which he says in his second Epistle, you

also will have another and no little consolation.

And to wait, he says, for His Son from heaven, shewing
especially that the terrible things are now before them¹, but1 iv me-
the good things are for the future ⁴¹, when Christ shall come ahili?
from heaven. See how much hope is required, in that He
Who was crucified has been raised, that He has been taken
up into heaven, that He will come to judge the quick and
the dead.

Chap. ii. l, ⁶2. For ymnus-elom, brethren, know om· entrance
in emto you, that it was not in vain ; But even after that we
lead seffered before, and were sltamefully entreated, as pse
know, at Philippi, we were bold in our 0οά to spealc meto
you the Gospel of 0οά with mue-lc eontention.

Great indeed were your actions also, but yet neither did
we have recourse to human speech. But what he says
above, that also he repeats here, that from both sides is
shewn what was the nature of the Proclamation, from the

selves, he says, know om· entrance in unte you, that it was
ποι in. vain, that is, that it was not according to man, nor of
any common kind. For being fresh from great dangers,
and deaths, and stripes, we immediately fell into dangers.
Bac, he says, even aster that we had ἥψω-θεῖ before, and
were slmmefully entreated, as ξομ) know, at Philippi, ‘ece were
bold in our God. Do you see how again he refers the whole
to God? to spealc unio you the Gospel of 0οά wille much
contevtioffl. It is not possible, he says, to say, that thereadff„
indeed we were in danger, but here we are not, yourselves
also know, how great was the danger, with how much con-

tention3 we were among you. Which also he says in his³a²7mla;,
taken as
‘alarm.'
