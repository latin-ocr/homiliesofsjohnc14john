St. Paul could ylory in delium-auce, yet die without shame. 33 j

my bonds, think shame of the matter, so manifold good hath FIsffifl·
it caused to me, thatb it hath given confidem-e to others. For ’
11131 we should be bound for Christ, is no shame, but for sear
of bonds to betray aught that is Christ's‚ this is 51131110.
When there is no such thing, bonds are even a cause ofbold—
ness. But since I have ofttimes escaped dangers, and have
this to boast of to the unbelievers, do not straightway think
I am put to shame, if now it should turn out otherwise. The
one event no less 111311 1110 other gives you boldness. Note
how he brings this forward in his own person, which he does
in many other places, as in the Epistle to the Romans3 Forfbom· 1.

says not in ignorance, (for he knew 11131 110 was not then to
die, but some time after.) Yet even now does 110 prepare
their seul.

Ver. 21. For to me, 110 says, to lie-e is sla-ist, ancl to dle εἰς

In dying, he means, I shall not have perished, for Ι have
my life in myself: then would they truly slay me, had they
power through this sear to 0351 saith out of my soul. But 35
long 35 Christ is with me, even though (103111 overtake 1110,
51111 I live, and in this present life, not this, but Christ is my life.

Such ought a Christian to 110 ! I live not, he says, the common lGngi 2,
life. How livest thou then, O blessed Paul? Dost thou not ²0·
see the sun, dost thou not breathe the common air? art thou

not nourished with the same food 35 others? dost thou

not tread the earth 35 we? needest thou not sleep, nor
clothing, nor shoes? what meanest thou by, I liz-e not?

how dost thou not live? Why boastest thou thyself? No
boasting is here. For if indeed the fact did not witness to

him, a man might with some show call it boasting3 but is
facts do witness, how is boasting here? Let us then leam

how he lives not, for 110 himself says in another place, I am Gal. 6,

crucffied to the world, aud the world to me. Hear then how ¹⁴·
