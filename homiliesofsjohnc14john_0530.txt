500 St. Clzrysostom asks to be told if thouyltt in fault.

ξΤΙΗΕΞὸ· why art Thou not there? Because 1 wish all to be together,

'¹ ' ⁸ and not to be separated. Let us therefore crowd together.
Let us bind one another together in love, let no one separate
us. If any one accuses, or is offended, let him not retain it
in his mind, whether against his neighbour, or against us.
This favour l ask of you, to come to 115, and bring the accu-

ἑῑὶ, aa sation‚ and receive an apology¹ from us. Reprove kim, it

Bergae& says, lest laaply lte laath, not said it. Reprove kim, lest kaply

153 ⁸ thereto. For then either we have excused ourselves, or being
condemned have asked pardon, and henceforth endeavour
not to fall into the same faults. This is expedient both for
you and for us. For you indeed having accused us perhaps
without reason, when you have leamed the truth of the mat-
ter, will stand corrected, and we have offended unawares and
are corrected. It is not expedient sor you to be indifferenti.
For punishment is appointed for those who utter any idle
word. But we put off accusations, whether false or true.
The false, by shewing that they are false3 the true, by not
again doing the same things. For it must needs happen that
he who has the care of so many things should 116 ignorant,
and through ignorance commit errors. For if every one of
you having a house, and presiding over wife and children,
and slaves, one more and another fewer, among souls that are
so easily numbered, is nevertheless compelled to commit many
errors involuntarily, or from ignorance, or when wishing to
set something right3 much more must it be so with us, who
preside over so many people.

And may God still multiply you and bless 115, the little
with the great! For although the care becomes greater stom
the increase of numbers, nevertheless we do not cease pray-
ing that this our carc may be increascd, and that this num-
ber may be added too, and be many times as great and with-
out limit. For fathers, although osten harassed by the num-
ber os their children, nevcrthelcss do not wish to lose any
one. All things are equa] between us and you, even the
very chief os our blessings. Ι do not partake of the holy

 

ῑᾶδιαφορεῖν. 1111, Par. adds the word from one Ms. It meam, ‘not to mind
whether your complaints are true or not.’
