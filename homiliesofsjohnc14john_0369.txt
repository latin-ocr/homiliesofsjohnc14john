Τ lle Elect worth sufferinyfor. 339

Ver. 4, 5. Kuowiuy, bretlzreu heloved, your eleetiou os Hom.
Godk. For our Gospel came not to you iu word only, buc ‘
also iu power, and in tlte Holy Glzost, aad in mue-lt assur-
anee, as ye lcuow what mamzer of men we were amous] you
sor your salce.

What is this that he says? Pe lcuow what mamzer (ff
meu we were among) you ‚2 Here also he touches upon his
own good actions, but covertly. For he wishes first to
enlarge upon their praises, and what he says is something· of
this sort. We knew that you were men of great and noble
sort, and that you were of the Elect. For this reason¹ we also

meu we were amous] you, is the expression of one shewing
that with much zeal and much vehemence we were ready to
give up our lives for your sake3 and for this thanks are due

them confirm them, but his reminding them that they too
themselves had displayed a fortitude corresponding¹ to their¹ ἀντίρ-
zeal: accordingly he says, ΨΜ

Ver. 6. And ye became followers of us, ancl of the Low-d,
haviuy received the word in much afflictiou with joy of the
Holy Ghost.

Strange! what an encomium is here! The disciples have
suddenly become masters! They not only heard the word,
but they quickly arrived at the same height with Paul. But
this is nothing 10 that which follows. For see whereunto he
raises them, saying, Y e became follow-ers of the Low-d. How?
Havinq received {lte word in much affliction, with joy of the
Holy Gleost. Not merely in affliction‚ but in much affliction.

And this we may learn from the Acts of 1116 Apostles, how Acts17‚
they raised a persecution against them. And they troubled 5-8.
all the rulers of the city, and they instigated'2 the city againstffkvmff·
