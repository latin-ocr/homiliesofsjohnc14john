PREFACE.

THE present Volume completes the cominentaries of
St. Chrysostom on the shortcr Epistles of St. Paul. It con-
sists entirely of Homilies delivered at Constantinople, and
one may perhaps remark some indications of a more matured
and severer character than in earlier works. He refers
several times to his responsibility as presiding in the Church‚
and sometimes threatens discipline as in that capacity, and
from this it is that the date of the Homilies is chiefly to be
gathered. The end of Hom. ix. on the Philippians, espe-
cially p. 113. is sufficient for those Homilies. The close of
Hom. iii. on Colossians, pp. 221-3. is still more express for
them. Hom. viii. on 1 Thessalonians‚ p. 4⁶25. and Hom. iv.
on 2 Thessalofflans, p. 501—2. are to the like purpose.

Hom. viii. on 1 Thessalonians, seems also to be that which
is referred to in Hom. iii. on Ep. to Philemon, Tr. p. 361. as it
contains a promise to discuss at some future time the subject
there taken up.

Phil. ii. 6. and Col. i. 15. &c. give rise to doctrinal dis-
cussions. The readiness in argument, which they suppose in
hearers, is greater than one would expect. Hom. v, on
Colossians goes farther into the system of typical interpreta-
tion than is usual with St. Chrysost01n3 though the system is
in fact acknowledged by him frequently, as in the passage
on marrIage, which closes the Homilies on the Colossians,
and which, though scarcely admissible in modern taste, is
one os great value, and of a saintly purity. The close of
Hom. iv. on Colossians is most instructive with regard to the
use of the Historical Books of the Old Testament‚ and
