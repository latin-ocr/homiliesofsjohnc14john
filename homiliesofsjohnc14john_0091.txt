One Text of St. Paul overthrow-3 numerous Heresies. 61

a sharp two-edged sword‚ wheresoever it falls, though it be Heb. 4,
among ten thousand phalanxes, easily cuts through and de· gem
stroys, because it is sharp on every side, and nought can16·
bear -its edge3 so are the words of the spirit. For by these
words he has laid low the followers of Arius of Alexandria,

of Paul of Samosata, of Marcellus of Galatia, of Sabellius the
Libyan, of Marcion that was of Pontus, of Valentinus, of
Manes, of Apollinarius of Laodicea, of Photinus, of Sophro-
nius, and, in one word, all the heresies. Rouse yourselves
then to behold so great a spectacle, so many armies falling

by one stroke, lest the pleasure of such a sight should escape
you. For if when chariots contend in the horse race there is
nothing so pleasing as when one of them dashes togetherb
and overthrows whole chariots with their drivers, and after
throwing down many with the charioteers that stood thereon,
drives by alone towards the goal, and the end of the course,
and amid the applause and clamour which rises on all sides

to heaven, with coursers winged as it were by that joy and
that applause, sweeps over the whole ground 3 will not
the pleasure be much greater here, when by the grace of God

we overthrow at once and in a body the combinations and
devilish machinations of all these heresies together with their
charioteers?

And if it seem good to you, we will first arrange the
heresies themselves in order. Would you have them in the
order of their impiety, or of their dates? Let us take the
order of time, for it is difficult to judge of the order of their
impiety. F irst then let Sabelliusc the Libyan come forward.
