The Biskop God's Ambassador. 223

socioty¹ with Christ, the other good things, which neither we HOM-
aro able to tell to you, nor you to hear, so long as we are in¹ HI'
this flcsh, and the present life. Ambassadors then wc are, 052 22222
and we wish to enjoy honour, not for our own sakes, God
forbid, for we know its worthlessness, but for yours; that

ye may hear with earnestness the things we say ; that ye may

be profited, that not with listlessness or indifference ye may
attend to what is spoken. See ye not ambassadors, how all

pay court t02 them? We are God’s ambassadors to men 32⁹?qu-
but, if this offend you θ, not we, but the Episcopato itselffmm*
not this man or that, but the Bishop. Let no one hear me,

but the dignity. Lot us then do every thing according to

the will of God, that we may live to the glory of God, and

be counted worthy of the good things promised to those that

love Him, through the grace and lovingkindness, &c. &c³
