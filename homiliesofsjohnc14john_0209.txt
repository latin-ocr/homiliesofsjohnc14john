Pvresent ease not the way to Heaven. 179

ease, and let us not seek luxury, whence great afflietion and ΗοΜ.
pain is born. Let us labour a little time upon the earth, that XV.
we may have continual enjoynient in heaven. Let us afflict

 

ourselves in this transitory life, that we may attain rest in
that which is endless. Let us not be remiss in this short life,
lest we groan in that which is endless.

See ye not how many are here in affliction for the sake of
worldly things? Suppose thyself one of them, and bear thy
affliction and thy pain, feeding on the hope of things to
come. Thou art not better than Paul or Peter, who never
obtained rest, who passed all their life in hunger and thirst
and nakedness. If thou wouldest attain the same things with
them, why journeyest thou along a contrary road? If thou
wouldest arrive at that City, of which they have been deemed
worthy, walk along the path which leadeth thither. The
way of ease leadeth not thither, but that of afflietion. The
former is broad, the latter is na1·row; along this let us wall<‚
that we may attain eternal life in Christ J esus our Lord,
with Whom, to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be

honour, might, power, now and ever, and world without end,
Amen.
