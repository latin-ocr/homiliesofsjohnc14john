them, even did they say aught to the purpose3 as it is, however,
obligations apart even, it behovcs to shun those things. And
not after Christ, he saith. For were it in such sort a matter
done by halves, that ye were able to serve both the one and
the other, not even so ought ye to do it; as it is, however, he
suffers you not to be after Christ. These things withdraw
you from Him. Having first shaken to pieces the Grecian
observances, he next overthrows the J ewish ones also.
For both Greeks and Jews practised many observances2
but the former from philosophy, the latter from the Law.
First then, he makes at those against whom lay the heavier
accusation. How, not ‹gfter Clu-ist {2

that he did not add, ⁶ which is the clun-ch? Others again
say it is with reference to The F ather, that he says that the
fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him, but wrongly. First,
because to dwell, cannot strictly be said of God: next,
