the one spake to the other, and sileneed him by saying,

received no hurt to His own glory‚ wherefore it is written,
God halh hz'yhly escalled Him, and yiven Him a Name which
is above every name. When the blessed Paul hath made
mention of the flesh‚ he fearlessly speaks of all His humiliation.
For until he had mentioned that He took the form of a ser·
vant, and while he was speaking of His Divinity‚ behold how
loftily he doth it, (lostily‚ Ι say, according to his power3 for he
speaks not according to His worthiness, seeing that he is not
able.) Beiny in theform of God, He thouyht it not robbery
lo be equal wilh God. But when he had said, that He
became Man, henceforth he discourseth of His low estate,
being confident that the mention of His low estate would not
harm His Divinity‚ since His flesh admitted this.

Ver. 9—-1 1. W herel'ore God also hath. hiyhly exalted H im,
and yiven Him a Name which is above every name: that at
the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of thinys in heaven,
and thinys in earlh„ and thinys under the earlh,‚· aud that
every conyzae should confess that Jesus Christ is Lorcl, to the
ylory of God the Falher. We well say against the heretics,
If this is spoken of one who was not incarnate, if of God the
Word, how did He highly exalt Him? Wasit1 as if He gave
Him something more than He had before? He would then
have been made imperfect in this point, and would have
been made perfect for our sakes. For if He had not done

 

good deeds to us, He would not have obtained that
honour! And halh- yicen Him a Name. See, He had not
even a name, as they say! But how, if He received it as His
due, is He found herem to have received it by grace, and as a
gift? And that a Name which z‘s above every name: and of
what kind let us see is that Name? that at the Name of
Jews, saith He, every lmee should bow. They (the heretics)
explain name by glory. This glory then is above all glory‚
and this glory is in short that all worship Him! But ye hold
yourselves far off from the greatness of God, who think that
