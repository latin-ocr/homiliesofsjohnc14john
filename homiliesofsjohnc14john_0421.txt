Early Illarriaye expedient for seculm· per-cons. 391

th21t then do I advise? That you may extirpate the roots, HOM-
so many of you as have young sons, and are about to bring {ss
them up to a worldly life, quickly (lraw them under the yoke (υ)
of marriage. For since whilst they are yet young desires
trouble them, for the time before marriage restrain them
by admonitions, threats, fears, promises, and nurnberless other
methods. But at the time of marriage, let no one defer it.
Behold, I speak the words of a 1natch-maker1, that you should ¹ '31qu-
let your sons marry. But I am not ashamed to speak thus, ’ἔας’
since Paul was not ashamed even to say, Deffraud ye not one ἔ Cor-7,
tlze other, which seems more shameful than what I have said, ’
yet he was not ashamed. For he did not pay heed to words,
but to the acts that were set right by words. then therefore
thy son is grown up, before he enters upon wal-fare, or any
other course of life, consider of his marriage. And if he
sees that thou wilt soon take a bride for him, and that the
time intervening will be short, he will be able to endure the
flame patiently. But if he perceives that thou art remiss
and slow, and waitest untilh he shall acquire a large income,
and then thou wilt contract a marriage for him, despairing
at the length of the time, he will readily fall into fornication.
But alas! that root of all evils, avarice, is here also in fault*⁴
For since no one cares how far his son shall be sober and
modest, but all are mad for gold, for this reason no one
makes this a matter of concern. Wherefore I exhort you
first to regulate well their souls. For if he find his bride
chaste, and know her body alone, then will both his desire
be vehement, and his fear of God the greater, and the
marriage truly honourable, receiving bodies pure and un—
defiled3 and the offspring will be full-charged with blessing,
and the bride and bridegroom will comply with one another,
for both being inexperienced in the manners of others, they
will submit to one another. But one that begins when
younger to wax wanton‚ and so has had experiencc of
the ways of harlots⁷ for the first and second evening will
praise his own wife3 but after that he will soon fall back into

that wantonness, that dissolute and disorderly laugh ter, seekin g
