1 Tuas. And how, you say, is it possible to bc children qf the day?
5, 6-8. Just as it is said, ‘ children osdcstruction' and ⁴ children ofhell.’
Mat.23‚ &Vlicrcsore Christ also said to the Phan'sees, Woe unco you-
¹⁵· for ye compass sea ancl land to malfe one proselyte, ancl when
he is made, ye make him lhe child of hell. And Paul said,
got& For which thinys' sake the wratk of God cometh upon the
⁰ children qf clisobedienee. That is, those who do the works
of hell and the works of disobedience. As therefore the
children of God are those who do things pleasing to God,
so those are children of day and children of light, who do the
