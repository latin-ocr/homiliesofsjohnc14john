who oppose and contend against the doctrines. For this he

has intimated by saying, For alc· men have not ficith. And
here he seems to me not to glance at dangers, but at men
who contradicted and hindered his word, as did Hymenaeus,

and Alexander the copper-smith. For he says, 116 ΙιῑιίΙιΞΤῙῑὲῃ·

the Palace,' so these wicked men from whom he wishes to be
delivered are of that sort, he says, to whom it is given not to
believe ¹¹. At the same time by saying this, he also excites

Samuel over the men of Ascalon, so Israel over thirty-two
kings. If where there was need of arms, and osbattle array,
