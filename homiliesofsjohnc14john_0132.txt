102 St. Paul's care {o know about the Plec'lippiates.

saying, I trust in tlte Lorcl Jesch, that is, I have good hope
God will grant me this, that l too may be of good courage,
when I know your state. As Ι refreshed you when ye heard
the very things of 1116 which ye had prayed for, that the
Gospel had advanced, that its enemies were put to shame,
that the means by which they thought to injure, rather made
me rejoicc; thus too do Ι wish to learn of your affairs, that
I may be of good courage when Ι know your state. Here he
shews that they ought to rejoice for his bonds, and to be con-
formed to them, for they begat in him great pleasure, for 1116
words, that I too may be of qood eonffort, imply that ye be
so t00.

Oh, what longing had 116 toward Macedonia! he testifies
the same 10 1116 Thessalonians, when he says, But we, bretlzren,
boiny takewsrom yousor a short time, ᾇνε. Η616 116 56)]5,
Ι trust to send Te'motley that I may know your state, which
is a proof of excessivo care: sor when he could not himself
be with them, he sent his disciples, as he could not endure to
remain, even for a little time,in ignorance of their state. For
he did not learn 611 things by revelation of the Spirit, and for
this we can see some reason; for if the disciples had believed
that it were so, they would have lost all sense of shame³, but
now froin expectatiou of concealment, they were more easily
corrected. In a high degree did hc call their attention by
saying, that I too may be of qood comfort, and rendered them
more zealous, so that, when Timothy came he might not find
any other state of things, and report it to him. He seems to
have acted in like sort in his own person, when he delayed
his coming to the Corinthians, that they might repcnt; where-
fore he wrote, to sparo you I camo not as yet to Cosmum sor
his love was manifested not simply in reporting his own state,
but in his desire to learn of 1116115, sor this is the part of 6
50111 which has a care of others, which takes thought for
them, Which is always wrestling in spirit for them.

At the sanie 111116 100, 116 honours them by sending
T iinothy. ‘ What sayest thou? dost thou send Timothy? and
whcrefore?’ Because I have Jzo one lz'kemi,¹z(locl; that is,
