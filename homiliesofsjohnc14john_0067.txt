sor those who have died in sins. They deserve wailing; they

deserve beating os the breast and teare. For tell me what

hope is there, when our sins acconipany us Thither, where

without the Seal! they indeed deserve our wailing, they deserve

our groans3 they are outside the Palace, with the culprits¹, ¹ „aq-⁶435.
