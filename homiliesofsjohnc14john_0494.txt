464 False persua-siout= the occasion qs the present Epistle.

For since that hope supported them, and did not allow
them to yicld to the present circumstances¹, the* devil wish-
ing to cut it off, as being a kind of anchor, when he was not
able to persuade them that the things to come were false,
went to work another way, and having suborned¹' certain
pestilential men, endeavoured to deceive those who believed
into a persuasion that those great and splendid things had
received their fulfilment. Accordingly these men then said
that the Resurrection was already past. But now they said
that the Judgment and the coming of Christ were at hand,
that they might involve even Christ in a falsehood, and
having persuaded them that there is hereaster no retribution,

,Iesus Christ be witlz you all. He does not here mean, that
this is the token,—for it is probable that others also imitated
this,—but that I write the salutation with mine own hand,
as is the custom also now among us, For by the subscrip-
tion the writings‘·' of those who send letters are made
known. But he comforts them, as being excessively
pincheddl by their troubles, both praising them from their
present state, and encouraging them from a prospect of
the futurity, from the punishment, and from the recompenso of
good things prepared sor them, he more clearly enlarges upon
the topic, not indeed revealing the time itself, but shewing
the sign of the time, namely, Antichrist. For a weak soul
