we shall not soon fall into it. For this reason God has
threatened punishment3 since if it was not attended with
great advantage to think of it, God would not have threat-
ened it. But because the remembrance of it is able to work
great good, for this reason He 1135 put into our souls the

‘mamm-roff of it, as a wholesome medicine. Let us not then

threat overlook the great advantage arising from it, but let us con-
tinually advert to 11, 31 our dinners, at our suppers. For
conversation about pleasant things profits the 50111 nothing,
but renders it more languid, 11111 that about things painful
and melancholy cuts off all that is relaxed and dissolute in
it, and convcrts 11, and braces it when unnerved. He who
converses of theatres and actors does not benefit it, but
