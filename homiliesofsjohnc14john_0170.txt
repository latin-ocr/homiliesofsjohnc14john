was no season, there was no time in which his course acl-
vanced not. He wished not to take, but to snatch the prize3
for in this way we may take it. He who giveth thc prize
standeth on high, the prize is laid up on high.

See how great a distance this to run over! See how great
is the ascent! Thither we must fly up with the wings of
the Spirit, otherwise it is impossible to surmount this height.
Thither must we go with the body, for it is allowed. For
our conversation is in heaven, there is the prize3 seest thou
the runners, how they live by rule, how they touch nothing
that relaxes their strength, how they exercise themselves
every day in the palaestra, under a master, and by rule? Do
thou too imitate them, or rather exhibit greater eagerness,
for the prizes are not equal: many are those who would
hinder you, live by rule: many are the things which relax
your strength3 make ita agile' sor thy feet: sor it is possible
so to do, it comes not naturally, but by our will. Let us
bring it to lightneSS, lest our swiftnessb of soot be hindered
by the weight of other things. Teach thy feet to be sure,
for there are many slippery places, and if thou fallest, straight-
way thou losest much. But yet if thou sall, rise up again.
Even thus mayest thou obtain the victory. Never attempt
slippery things, and thou wilt not fall; walk upon firm ground,
up with thy head, up with thine eyes3 these commands the
trainers give to those who run. Thus thy strength is sup-
ported3 but if thou stoopest downward, thou fallest, thou art
relaxed. Look upward, where the prize is3 the sight of the
prize increaseth the determination of our will3 this hope suf-
fereth not to perceive toil or distress⁰, it maketh the distance
appear short3 and what is this prize? No palm braneh, but
what? The kingdom of heaven, everlasting rest, glory toge—
ther with Christ, the inheritance, brotherhood, ten thousand
good things, which it is impossible to name. It is impossible
to describe the beauty of that prize; he who hath it alone
knoweth it, and he who is about to receive it. It is not of
gold, it is not ofjewcls, it is far more precious. Gold is mire,
