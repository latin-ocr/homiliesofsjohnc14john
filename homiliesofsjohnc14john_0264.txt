so now, for by the grace of God much moderation ², much
virtue, hath been planted every where. Let us give thanks
then for all things, and not be over curious. For, we know
not the due time, but He, The Maker of the time, and The

and let us send up glory to God, that making for all things
an offering of thanksgiving, we may be counted worthy of
His lovingkindness, through the grace and love toward

man, &a
