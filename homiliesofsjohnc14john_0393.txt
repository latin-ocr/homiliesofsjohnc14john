He either means to say, ⁴ we were vehemently attached to
you,' or, ‘ as was likely, being bereaved for a season, we 611-
deavoured to see your face.' Observe the blessed Paul.
When of himself he cannot satisfy his longing, he does it
through others, as when he sends Timothy to the Philippians,

and the same person again to the Corinthians, holding inter-
course with them through others, when he cannot of himself.

For in loving them, he was like some mad person, not to be
restrained, nor to command himself¹ 111 his affection. 1 0222<-

this was not the work of God. For in the Epistle to the
Romans, he says that God hindei-ed him3 and elsewhere From

Satan is he speaking of? Some unexpected and 1 iolent tempt-
ations: for a plot, It says, being formed against him by
the Jews, he was detained three months 111 Greece. And it
is one thing to remain for the sake of the dispensation, and
willingly‚ and another to be hindered. For there he says,

that he loved them most of all. Even IPmcI, he says, 111-
