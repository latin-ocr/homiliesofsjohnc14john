than that which has taken place. For as in the case of
1111160015, when material is before 1110111, 110 who is skilled
111 1115 art 11505 11 10 good purpose, but he that is u'nskilsul
spoils it, and makes it a loss to him, so also in these matters.
How then will it be a gain? If thou givest thanks to God,
if thou dost not wail bitterly, if thou utterest the words of Job,

‘ that ,Ρ saycst thou, ⁵ the Lord hath taken away? The
thies hath taken away, and how canst thou say, the Lord
hath taken away θ’ Wonder not, sor even Job, of things
which the devil took away, said, These the Lord hath
taken away. And if he had the boldness to speak thus,
how shalt 1101 111011 say of what 1110 thief has taken, The
Lord hath taken away? Tell me, whom dost thou admire?

him, who has given ahns? For say not, ‘ I 11111 1101 obliged.

did he take Job’s possessions with his knowledge or will.
For how could he ? Nevertheless, 110 wrestled ¹¹.

And it is in thy power 10 receive as great a reward, as if
thou hadst cast it away willingly. And perhaps we admire
this man more, who thanksully suffers wrongs, than him who
gives spontaneously. And why? Because the latter indeed
15 fed with praises, and supported by conscience, and has
good hopes 3 and having besore¹ borne manfully the privation
of his goo(lS‚ he then cast them away3 but the former, Whilst
yet bound to them, was forcibly deprived of them. And it
is not 1110 5111110 thing, having first been induced to part with
riches, in that way to bestow them, as it is while yet retaining
1110 possession to be deprived of them. If thou wilt say these
words, thou wilt receive many times as much, and even more
than J 01). For he received twice 115 11111011 here, but to thee
Christ has promised a hundred sold. From the fear of God,
