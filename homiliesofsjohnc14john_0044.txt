14 C'laz'ms os Christ sor His ,Ministers a! all times.

Pur-1.. grace, and of trials, and of tribulations, let us, I bcseech you,
1' ’Ἄ be partakers. How many of those who stand herc, yea,
rather all, would fain share with Paul in the good things to
come! It is in your power if ye are willing, 011 behalf of
those who have succeeded to his ministry, when they suffer
any hardship for Christ's sake, 10 take their part and succour
them. Hast thou 56611 thy brother in trial? Hold out a hand!
Hast thou seen thy teacher in conflict? Stand by him! But,
says one, there is no one like Paul! now for disdain! now
for criticism! So there is no one like Paul? Well, Ι grant it.
Matt. But, He tlzat recen-eth, saith He, a prophet in tlze name of

envyings. Is this a little matter, to bear ten thousand

 

tongues, when one might have but one's own cares? Alas!
what shall 1 do? for I am in a strait between two hard things.
For I long to urge you 011 and encourage you to the alliance
and succour of the saints of God3 but I sear lest some one
should suspect another thing, that Ι say this not sor your

attend, I convince you by my very words ; the gain is not so
much for you as for them. For ye, if ye give, will give
those things froin which, willing or unwilling, ye must soon
