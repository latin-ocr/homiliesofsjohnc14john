Men too carious about the end of the world, 427

Hear for instance what the blessed Paul now says, But Qf IX·
the times and seasonS, brethren, ye have no need that Ι write

unto you. Why has he not said that no one knows? why

has he not said, that it is not revealed, instead of saying,

Ye have no need tlzat I write unco you? Because in that

case he would have grieved them more, but by speaking

For tell me, what would be the advantage? Let us suppose
that the end would be after twenty or thirty or a hundred

general dissolution. Now what concern is that of yours?
for if you make your own a good end, you will suffer no
harm from the other3 be it far off, or be it near. This 18
nothing to us.

For this reason Christ did not tell it, because it was not
expedient. But how, you say, was it not expedient? He
