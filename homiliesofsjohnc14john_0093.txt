No unequal Divinityfomzd 'in Scriptura 63

Wherefore being] zn the form of God, He was God. For Hom.
one fwm and anotherfot m is named, if the one be true, the VI
other is also. lee form os a servant means, Man by nature,
wheresore tlze form (ff God means, God by nature. And he
not only bears record os this, but of His equality too, as
St. John also doth, and that ΗΘ 15 in no way inseiioi to the
Father, for he saith, He tlzouylet it not a tlzmq to sezzek, to &gwy-

 

be equal with God. Now what 15 their wise reasoning? Nay,‘“ θ’
say they, he proves the very contrary· , for he says, that,
being] in tlte form Qf God, He seized not equality with God.
Now if He were God, how was He able to seize upon it?
and is not this without meaning? Who would say that one,
being a man, seized not on being a man ? sor how would any
one seize on that which he is? No, say they, buthe means
that being a lesser God, He seized not upon being equal
to the great God, Who was greater than He. Is there then
a great and a lesser God? And do ye bring in the doctrines of
the heathens to those of the Church? With them there is a
greater and a lesser God. lfit be so with us, Ι know nought
of the matter, for you will find it no where in the Scriptures:
there you will find a great God throughout, a lesser one no
where. If He were little, how would he be God? If man is
not greater or lesser, but the nature is one, and if that which
is not of this one nature is not man, how can there be a lesser
or a greater God, who is not of that same nature?

He who is little is not God, for He is every where called
great in the Scripturas 3 Great is the Lord, and ιᾳνειιίίμ lo be Ps.48,1.

But this, says Arius, is spoken of the Father, but the Son
