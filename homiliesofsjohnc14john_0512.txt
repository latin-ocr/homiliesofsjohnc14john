What sayest thou? is God glorified in them? Yea, he
says, in all His Saints. How? For when they that puff so
greatly see those who were scourged by them, who were
despised, who were derided, even those now near to Him,
it is His glory, 01· rather it is the glory both of them and of
Him. Of I-Iim indeed, because He did not forsake them;
of them, because 'they were thought worthy of so great
honour. For as it is His riches‚ that there are faithful
men, so also it is His glory that there are those who
are to enjoy His blessings. It is the glory of Him that is
good, to have those to whom He may impalt of His
beneficence. And to be admo-ecl, he says, in all them
that believe, that is, llzrouylz tlzem [leat believe. See here
again, ‘²272 is used sor ³ll⁷zrouylz³. For through them He is
shown to be admirable. For when He brings to so much
splendour those who were pitiable and wretched, and who
had suffered unnumbered ills, and had belieVesL then His
power is shewn3 because although they seem to be deserted
here, yet nevertheless they there enjoy great glory. Then
especially is shewn all the glory and the power of God. And
how ? Hear. For he subjoins,

Because om· testimony among) you was believed in that day.

Ver. ll. cherefore also we pray always for you.

That is, when those are brought into public- view, who have
suffered unnumbered ills, (done) that they might apostatize
srom the saith, and yet have not yielded‚ but have remained
saithful; God is glorified. Then also is shewn the glory of
these men. Since therefore many pretend saith, pronounce
no one happy before the end. For in that day will be shewn
those who believed. leerefore also we prczy, he says,
always sor you, that our God ¹would count you worthy of
His ealliny, amlsulfll all tlte yooclpleasure of His yoodness,
anal the work offecitlc πῖθι power.

Thac He may cowll you, he says, worthy (ff His ealliny,
showing that many also have been cast away. Therefore he
has added, ‹tnrlfulfil all the yoorlpleasme Qf His qoodneSS.
