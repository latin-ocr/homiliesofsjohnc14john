HOMILY Ι.

PfflL. i. 1, 2.

Paul aud Timotheus, tlte servants of Jesus Christ, to all tlze
saints in Christ Jesus which, are at Philippi, fellow-
Bislzopsss and Deaeons .· Grac-e be unte you, aad peace, from
God our Fatlzer‚ andfrom the Lord Jesus Christ.

HERE‚ as Wn'ting to those of equal honour, he does not set
down his rank of Teacher, but another, and that a great one.
And what is that? He calls himself a servant, ancl not an
Apostle. For great truly is this rank too, and the sum of all
good things, to be a servant of Christ, and not merely to
be called so. lee servant of Christ, he truly is free from
sin, and being a genuine servant, he will not be capable of
becoming a servant to any other, since so he would not be
Christ's servant, but by halves. And in writing to the Ro-

mans again, he says, Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ. But Rom. 1,

writing to the Corinthians and to Timothy he calls himself¹⁸

an Apostle. On what account then does he do this? Not
because they were superior to Timothy. Far from it.
But rather because he honours them, and shews them atten-
tion, beyond all others to whom he wrote. For he also
bears witness to great virtue in them, And besides, there
indeed he vvasb about to order many things, and therefore
assumed his rank as an Apostle. But here he gives them no
injunctions but such as they could apprehend of themselves.
