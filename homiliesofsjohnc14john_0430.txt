to all who are willing to injure me. Those 01 my servants
who formerly feared 1116 now despise 1116, and traniplc upon
1116. 11 any one has becn bcnefited, he has forgotten the
benefit he received from hi1n3 if any one was illtrcated by
the dcpartcd, to return the grudge against him, he lets loose
his anger upon me. These things do not susser 1116 to bear
my widowhood, or to lanient with moderation. It is for
these things that 1 afflict myself, for these things I bewail.
How then shall we comfort such? What shall we say?
How shall we banish their sorrow? ln the first place let me
endeavour to convince them, that their wailing proceeds not
110111 these things they say, but 110111 311 unreasonable passion.
For if you mourn for these things, you ought always to 111011111

nor the breaking off of your society? And what can they
say, who even enter into second marriages? Sure enough‘!
For it is not their former husbands that they long sor. But
let us not direct our discourse to them, but to those who
preserve a kind affection towards the departed. Wherefore
dost thou lament thy child? Wherefore thine husband?
The former, because I had not enjoyed him, you say 3 the
latter, because Ι expected that I should have enjoyed him
longer. And this very thing, what want of saith does it argue,
to suppose that thy husband or thy son constitutes thy safety,
and not God! How dost thou not think to provoke Him?
For often on this account He takes them away, that thou
mayest not be so bound to them, so that it may withdraw
thy hopes from them. For God is jealous‚ and wills to be
loved by us most of all things: and that, because He loves
us exceedingly. For ye know that this is the custom of those
who love to distraction. They are excessively jealous, and
would choose rather to throw away their life, than to be
surpassed in esteein by any of their rival lovers. On this
account also God hath taken him, because of these wordsg.
