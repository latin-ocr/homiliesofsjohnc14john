children of disobedience.

By many things he had been withdrawing thern3 by
the benefits which are already given, by the evils to come
from which we had been delivered, being who, and where-
fore3 and all those considerationS, as, for instance, who we
were, and in what circumstances, and that we were delivered
theresrom, how, and in what manner, and on what terms.
These were enough to turn one away, but this one is of
greater force than all; unpleasant indeed to speak of, not

It is worth inquiring here, what can be the reason why he
calls the corrupt life, members, and man, and body, and again
the virtuous life, the same. And if the mam means ‘ sins,’
how is it that he saith, with his cleecls! For he said once,
the old man, shewing that this is not man, but the other.
For the moral choice doth rather determine one than the
substance, and is rather mem than the other. For his sub—

kingdom, but ssus sume choice: and we neither love nor hate
