cotos. fully grantest that God is, even though not Christ? 1 ask
¹' 24. thee then3 Is God without beginning? Thou wilt say, Cer-
tainly. Tell me then, why made He not men myriads of years
before? For they would have lived through a longer time.
For if to bc were well, much better were it to be for a.
¹ :twa longer time. They were now losers¹ by that time during
‘n m which they were not. Nay, they were not losers, but how,
He who made them alone knows. Again, Ι ask thee, why
did He not make all men at once? But his soul, whoever

 

was first made, hath so many years of existence, of which
that one is deprived which is not yet created. Wherefore
made He the one to be brought first into this world, and the
other afterwards?

Such things as these are really fit subjects for inquiry:

“goew‘ at all. But Ι will tell you the reason I spoke of. For sup-

that in the first times our race was in the position of boyhood;
in those that succeeded, of manhood3 and in these that are
near extreme age, of an old man. Now when the soul is at
its perfection, when the limbs of the body are unstrung, and
Plat. our war is over, we are then brought to philosophy. On the
Rep.vii. contrary, one may say, we teach boys whilst young. Yes, but
not the great doctrines, but rhetoric, and expertness with
language3 and the other when they are come to ripe-
ness of age. See God also doing the same with the Jews.
For just as though the Jews had been little children, he

flama-m children he lcd them on, through shadowy representations ⁶,
