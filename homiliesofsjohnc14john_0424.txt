lTfiffls· the naked limbs of women, for the time indeed you are
4”’8’(.101181110(1, but afterwards, you have nourished thence a
mighty sever. &Vlien you see women exhibited as it were in
the form of their bodies, and spectacles and songs containing
nothing else but irregular loves: such a woman, it is said,
loved such a man, and not obtaining him, hanged hersels3
1a1.step- and unlawsul loves having mothers¹ sor their object3 when
mothers you receive these things by hearing, and through women, and
through figures, yea,and even through old men, (for many there
put masks upon their faces, and play the parts of women,)
tell me, how will you be able to continue chaste afterwards,
these narratives, these sights, these songs occupying your
soul, and dreams of this sort henceforth succeeding. For it
is the nature of the soul for the most part to raise visions
of such things, as it wishes for and desires in the day time.
Therefore when you there both see base actions, and hear
base words, and receive indeed the wounds but do not
apply the remedies, how will not the sore 110 increased?
will not the disease become more intense3 and in a
much greater degree than in our bodies? For if we were
willing, our will admits of correction more easily than our

the disorder. WVhen therefore we gather to us indeed the
things that injure, but pay 110 regard to the things that benefit,

how can there ever be any health ?
On this account Paul said, even as the Gentiles wlco knew

not Gocl. Let us be ashamed, let us be afraid, if the Gentiles,
that know not God, are osten chaste. Let us be ashamed,
when we are worse than they. “ It is easy to achieve chastity,
if we will, is we withdraw ourselves from those things that are
111] 11110115, since it is not even easy to avoid fornication, if we
will not. For what is 111010 easy than 10 go to the 1111111101-
place? but from the excess oflazincss it is become difficult, not
only in the case of women, but sometimes even in that of men.
What is 111010 easy than to slcep? but we have made even
this difficule. Many however of the rich toss themselves
through a whole night, from their not waiting for the need of
slecp, and then slecping. And in short nothing is difficult,
