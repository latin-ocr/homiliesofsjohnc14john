204 VVork of tlte Son in Redemption, how μνεία.

pose the Son exeluded, he ascribes the whole both to the Son,
and to the F ather. For lle indeed translated us, but the
Son surnished the cause. For what saith he? Wleo delivered
us from tlte power Qs' darkness. But this is the same with,
In Whom we leave thesull redemption ¹, even the forqe‘ve-
mess of sins. For had we not been forgiven our sins, we
should not have been translated. So here again the words, In
Wleom. And he said not ‘redemption ‘·'‚' but fall redemp-
tion ³, so that we shall not fall any more, nor become liable
to death.

gift of God, and to refleet upon what we have been delivered
from, and what we have obtained3 and so we shall be thank-
sul; so we shall heighten our love toward Him. What
sayest thou, O man? Thou art called to a kingdom, to the
kingdom of the Son of God—and art thou fidlffisj'fflmjng,
