sonings divide, and shake loose, so saith causes solidity and HOM-

compactness.

For seeing God hath bestowed upon us benefits surpassing
man's reasoning‚ suitably enough He hath brought in
saith. For it is not possible he can 110 stedsast, who demands
reasons. For behold all our lofty doctrines, how destitute
they are of reasonings, and dependent upon faith alone. God
is not any where, and is every where. What hath less reason
in it than this? Each by itsels is sull of difficulty. For,
indeed, He is not in place3 nor is there any place in which
He is. He was not made, He made not Himself, He never
·began to be. What reasoning will receive this, if there be
not saith? Does it not seem to be utterly ridiculous, and more
endless than a riddle?

Now that He hath 110 beginning, and is uncreate‚ and
uncircumscribed, and infinite, is, as we have said, a manifest
difficult53 but let us consider His Incorporealness, whether
we 0311 search 0111 11118 by rcasoning. God is incorporeal.
What is ineorporeal? A bare w6rd, and no more, for the
apprehension has received nothing, has impressed nothing
upon itself3 for if it does so impress, it comes to nature, and
what constitutos body. So that the mouth speaks indeed,
11111 1110 understanding knows not what it speaks, save one
thing only, that it is 1101 body, this is all it knows. And why
do I speak of God? In the 0380 of the soul, which is created,
inclosed, circumscribcd, what is incorporcalness? say!
shew! Thou canst not. Is it air? But air is body, even
though it be not 0011111301, and it is plain from many proofs
that it 18 a yielding body. Is it then firc ? But fire is body,
whilst the energy of the soul is bodiless. Wherefore? Be-
cause 11 penetrateth every where. But if it is not ¹¹ body,
then that which is incorporea] exists in place, therefore it 18
3180 circumscribed; and that which is circumscribed has
figure, and figures are linear, and lines belong to bodies.
Again, 11131 which is without figure, what 00110011110111 (1008
11 admit? It 1138 110 figure, no form, 110 011111110. Seest thou
how the understanding becomes dizzy ?

Again, That Nature is not susceptible of evil. But He is

h Savile conjectures that ⁴ not* should be inserted, and the sense 8001118 31180-
lutely to require it.
