refresh and gladden, and let the drinking cups and thc rest “
of the vessels be made from glass only3 but there, at the table
of the rich, let all the vessels be of silver and gold, [and the
semicircular table ³, not such as one can lift, but as two young
men can with difficulty move,] and let there be a gilded bowl
of half a talent weight, so that two young men can scarcely
move it¹. and the wine-jars lie in order, glittering sar beyond ivlieeri

all over with soft drapery. Here, again, let there be many
servants, in garments not less ornamented than those of the
guests, and bravely apparelled, and wearing loose trowsers,
beauteous to look upon, in the very flower of life, plump,
and well conditioned3 but there let there be only two servants
disdaining all that proud vanity. And let those have costly
meats, but these only enough to appease hunger, and inspire
cheerfulness. Have Ι said enough ? and are both tables
laid out with sufficient rninuteness? Is any thing wanting?
I think not. For Ι have gone over the guests, and the
costliness both of the vessels, and of the linen⁰‚ and the
meats. However, if we should have omitted aught, we shall
discover it as we proceed with our argument.

Come then, now that we have correctly drawn each table
in its proper outline, let us see at which ye will seat your-
selves, for Ι for my part am going to that of the blind, and
the lame, but probably the more part of you will choose the
other, that of the generals, that is so gay and splendid.
Let us then see which of them doth more abound in pleasure 3
for as yet let us not examine into the things of hereafter,
seeing that in those at least this of mine hath the supe-
riority. Wherefore? Because this one hath Christ sitting
down at it, the other men, this hath the Master, that
the servants. But say we nothing of these things as
yet3 but let us sce which hath the inore of present pleasure.
