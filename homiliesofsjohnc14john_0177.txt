PHIL. iii. 18—21.

(For many walle, of whom I have told you often, ancl now [etl
you even weepiny, that they are the enemies of the cros-9 of
Christ.- Whose end is destruction, who-se yod is their
belly, aud whose ylory ‘is ‘in their shame, who mind earthly
thinys.) For our conversation is in heavem from whence
also ure look for the Saviozcr, the Lorct Jesecs Christ.-
Who shall chansye om· vile body, that it may befashioned
like unto His ‘qlorious body, according] to the working]
whereby He is able eren to subdue alt chiny-9 meto Hine-sets]

NOTHING is so unbecoming in a Christian, and foreign
to his character, as to seek ease and rest. Nothing is so
foreign to our profession and enlistment, as to be engrossed
with the present life. Thy Mastor was crucified‚ and (lost
thou seek ease? Thy Master was pierced with nafis, and
dost thou live delicately? Do these things become a noble
soldier? WVherefore Paul saith, IlIany walle, of whom I have
told you often, aud now tell you even weepiny, that they are
enemies to the cross of Christ. Since there vvere some who
made a pretence of Christianity, yet lived in ease and luxury.
This is contrary to the Cross: wherefore he thus spoke. For
the cross belongs to a soul at its post for the sight, longing to
die, seeking nothing like ease, whilst their conversation is of
the contrary sort. So that if they say, they are of Christ,
still they are enemies of the Cross. For did they love the
Cross, they would strive to live a life befitting the Cross.
Was not thy Master hung upon the tree? Imitate Him in
some other way, if thou canst not in His own. Crucify thyself‚
