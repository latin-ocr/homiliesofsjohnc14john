Marvel not that generation ancl destruction take place in (3)
Baptism3 for, tell me, dissolving and cementing, are they not
opposite? It is evident, I suppose, to all. Such is the effect
of fire, for fire dissolves and destroys wax, but it cements
together metallic earth, and works it into gold. So in truth
here also, the force of the fire, having obliterated the statue
of wax, has displayed a golden one in its stead3 for in truth
before the Bath we were of clay, but after it of gold.
Whence is this evident? Hear him saying, Tleefirst man is l C0¹23
qf tlte earth, earthy, the second man is the Lord ¹ from ifssd‘ih

clay and gold3 but greater still do I find the differencely.
between heavenly and earthy3 not so widely do clay and
gold differ, as do things earthy and heavenly. Waxen we
were, and clay-formed. For the flame of lust did much
more melt us, than fire doth wax, and any chance temptation
did far rather shatter us than a stone doth things of clay.
And, if ye will, let us give an outline of the former lise, and
see whether all was not earth and water, and full of fluctu-
ation, and dust, and instability, and flowing away.

And if ye will, let us scrutinize not the former things, but
the present, and see whether we shall not find every thing
that is, mere dust and water. For what wilt thou tell me of?
authority and power? for nothing in this present life is
thought to be more enviable than these. But sooner may
one find the dust when on the air stationary, than these
things3 especially now. For to whom are they not under
subjection? To those who are lovers of them 3 to eunuchs;
to those who will do any thing for the sake of money3 to
the passions of the populace; to the whims of the more
powerful. He who was yesterday up high on his tribunal f,
who had his heralds shouting with thrilling voice, and many
to run before, and haughtily clear the way sor him through
