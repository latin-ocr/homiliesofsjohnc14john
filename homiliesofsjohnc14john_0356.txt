326 Unseemly exhibilions at weddinyfeasts.

COLQS· down, that they be used iu prayers and exhortations only,

*2194 and see how desirable 3 thing they will become. Nothing

doth so wipo out sins, as 16318. Tears shew even this bodily

countenance beautifu13 for they win the spectator to pity,

they make it respected in our eyes. Nothing is sweeter than

tearful eyes, For this is the noblest member we have, and

the 111081 beautiful, and the soul’s own. And therefore we

are so bowed therewith, as though we saw the soul itself
lamenting.

I have not spoken to you without a reason3 but in order

that ye may cease your attendance at weddings, at dancings‚

’χοροιὶ 31 satanica] persormances¹. For see what the devil hath

invented. Since nature itself hath withheld women from the

ontamu stage, and the disgraceful2 things enacted there, he hath

introduced into the women's chamber the furniture of the

11163116, Ι 1116311, wantons and harlots. This pestilence the

custom os marriages hath introduced, 01· rather, not of mar-

riage, God forbid! but of our own silliness. What is it thou

doest, O man? Thou marriest 3 wife for chastity, and pro-

016311011 of children3 what then mean these harlots? That

see it? It is quite indecent and disgraceful to introduce int-o

one's house lewd fellows and dancers, and all that 83131110
pomp.

Remember, he saith, my bouds. Marriage is 3 bond, a bond

‹⁷›rdained of God, 3 1131101 18 3 severing and a dissolving. It

is permitted you to embellish marriage with other things, such

3811111 tables, aud apparel. I do not cut off these things,

lest I should seem to be clownish to 311 extreme, and yet

{³52³- 24, Rebecca was content with her veil⁶ only3 still Ι (10 not cut them
