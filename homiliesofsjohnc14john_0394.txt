364 St. Paul's ardent love. He sent to qive comfort.

1'313'1‘155· Are the Macedonians, tell me, thy hope, O blessed Paul?
’ ’ Νο1 these alone, he says. Therefore hohas added, Are not με
also. For what, he says, is om· hope, or joy, or crown of re-
joicinq? Observe then the words, which are those of women,
inflamed with tenderness, and talking to their little children.
And crown qfrejoiciny, he sayS. For the name of crown was
not sufficient to express the splendour‚ but he has added, qf
rejoiciny also. Of what fiery warmth is this! Never could
either mother, 01· father, yea if they even met together, and
commingled their love, have shewn their own affection to be
equivalent to that of Paul. Joy and eroum, he says, that is,

planted and rooted by Paul. Who would not rejoice in such
a multitude of children, and in the goodness of those children?
So that it is not flattery. For he has not said pse simply, but

Gospel of Cleo-ist.

And this he says, not as extolling Timothy, but honouring
them, that he sent them his fellow-labourer, and minister of
the Gospel. As if he had said, Having withdrawn him from
his labours,we have sent to you the minister os God, and our
fellow-labourer in the Gospel of Christ. Then follows also
the cause,

To establis-le you, and to congfort yon concerne'ny your

Ver. 3. Tleat no man should he moved by these afflicle'ons.

What then does he say here? Because the temptations of
the teachers trouble their disciplcs, and 110 had theu fallen
into many temptations, as also he himself says, that Satan
hindered us, he has spoken thus to recover thei-n. And this
is what he says3 Once and again Ι would have come to you,
and was not able. Which was a proof of great violence, and
it is probable that this would trouble them, for disciples are
