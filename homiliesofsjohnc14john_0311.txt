he hath gone this way about, to charms, and old wives⁷ fables3

and the Cross indeed is dishonoured, and these spells pre-

NVherefore then, saith one, doth not God reprove it?

mind. These things, moreover, not even a Greek who hath ’

uuderstanding could endure. A certain demagogue in Athens

is reported once to have hung these things about him: when

a philosopher who was his instructor, on beholding them, re-

buked him, expostulated‚ satirized, made sport of him: but

we are in so wretched a plight, as even to believe in these

things!

 

And why, saith one, are there not now those who raise the
dead,and perform cures? Why, I do not at present say: but
why are there not now those who have a contempt for this
present life? Why serve we God for hire? When man’s
nature was weaker, when the Faith had to be planted, there
were even many such3 but now He would not have us to
hang upon these signs, but to be ready for death. Why then
clingest thou to the present life? why lookest thou not on
the future ? and for the sake of this indeed canst bear even to
commit idolatry, but for the other not so much as to restrain
sadness? For this cause it is that there are none such now,
because that life hath seemed to us honourless, seeing that
for its sake we do nothing, whilst for this, there is nothing
we refuse to undergo. And why too that other farce, ashes,
and soot, and salt? and the old woman again brought in?
A farce truly, and a shame! And then, ‘ an eye,’ say they,
‘ hath caught the child?

Where will these satanical doings end? How will not the
Greeks laugh? how will they not gibe when we say unto
them,‘ Great is the virtue of the Cross3' how will they be won,
