seest thou his excellent spirit? seest thou his habit of 101111- - ‘v'

also are men of like passions with you. Now if they thus
refused the honours paid them, men who by reason of the
humility and power of Christ wrought greater deeds than
Christ, (for He says, He that believella in Me shall (1010111114,
yreater works than those that I d0,) shall not we w1·etched¹²·³bs·
and miserable men do so, who cannot even beat away gnatsh,

much less devils? who have not power to benefit a single

man, much less the whole world, and yet think so much of
ourselves that the devil himself is not like us ?

There is nothing so foreign to a Christian soul as haugh- (3)
tiness. Haughtiness, I say, not boldness nor courage, for
these are congenial. But these are 0116 thing, and that
another3 so too humility is one thing, and meanneSS, flattery,
and adulation, another.

I will now, if yon wish, give you examples of all these
qualities, for these things which are contraries, seem in some
way to be placed near together, as the tares to the wheat,
and the 11101118 10 the rose, so that babes will easily be
deceived, while they who are men in truth, and are skilled in
spiritual husbandry, know how to separate what is really
good from the bad. Let me then lay before you examples

 

of these qualities from the Scriptures. What is fiattery, and
meanness, and adulation? Ziba flattered¹ David out onSan

was humble, for the deceitful are flatterers, as the magicians
are, when they say, O lciwq, livesor ever. v. Dan.
We shall find much to exemplify this in the Acts of St. 2, 4.
Paul. When he disputed with the Jews he did not flatter
them, but was humble-minded, (for he knew how to speak

boldly,) as when he says, Men and brethren, thouyle I have ἔὲΑιοὲε
