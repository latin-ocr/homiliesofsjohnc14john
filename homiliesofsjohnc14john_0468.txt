43& The Scorner “damnis-hed to weestfier himself]

they ought to laugh at, and sor what they ought especially to
mourn, but they confound and ‹listurb and disorder every
thing. On this account Ι grieve for them. What sayest
thou, O man, when thou art to rise again, and to give an ac-
count of thy actions, and to undergo the last sentence, dost
thou pay no regard indeed to 111050, but praetiso gratisying
thy belly, and being drunken ? And dost thou laugh at these
things? But I grieve for thee, knowing the evils that await
thee, the punishment that is about to overtake thee. And
sor this 1 most especially grieve, that thou dost laugh!
Mourn with 1110, grieve with me for thine own evils. Tell
1110, if one of thy friends perishes, dost thou not hate and
turn froin those who laugh at his end, and think them ene-
mies? But those who weep and syinpathize with thee thou
lovest. Thon indeed if the dead body of thy wife were laid
out, thou abhorrest him that laughs ε but when thy soul is done
to death, dost thou abhor him that weeps, and laughest
thou thyself? Seest thou how the devil has disposed us to
be enemios and adversaries to ourselves? For once let us
be sober, let us open our eyes, 101 us wateh, let us lay
hold 011 eternal life, let us shake off this long sleep.
