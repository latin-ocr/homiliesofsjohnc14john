22 Satan's dapes do qood from had motives.

that is, envying my reputation and constancy, and from de-
sire os my destruction, and the spirit of strifc, work with me 3
or that they themselves may be esteemed, and from the ex-
pectation that they will draw to themselves somewhat of my
glory. And some also ofyooclwill, that is, without hypocrisy,
with all earncstness.

Ver. 16. The (me preat-h Clu-ist qs'contehlion, not purely.

T hat is, not sincerely, nor from regard to the matter itsels;
but why? suppose'ny to add (qfflictz’on to my bonds. For as
they think that I shall thus fall into greater peril, they add
affliction to affliction. O cruelty! O ‹levilish instigation !
They saw him in bonds, and cast into prison, and still they
envied him. They would increase his calamitieS, and render
him subject to greater anger: well said he, secpposinq, for it
did not so turn out. They thought indeed to grieve me by

involve the preacher of Christ in greater perils, not only
shall they receive no reward, but shall be subject to venge—
ance and punishment.

Ver. 17. But the other of love, lmow ‘luy chat Iam setfor

It is, They are diminishing the weight of the account which

What he means is this: I have been appointed to preach,
I must give account, and answer for the work to which I
have been appointed 3 they help with me, that my answer
may be casy3 for if there be found many who have been in-
structed and have believed, my answer will be easy.

Ver. 18. W 1ιαί then ‚9 notzvithfstamliny every way, whether
iu. pretence, or z'n irath, Christ is preached.

See the wisdom of the Man. He did not vehemently
accuse 1110111, 11111 mentioned the result ; what difference does
it make to us, whether it be done in this or that way? not-
withstanding, every way, whether in pretence or in, irath,

f He takes the Gnspel herc in the Gospel. Theodoret takes it ofhis being
v<ense of St. Paul’s prcaehing of the a ehampion of the Gospel among men.
