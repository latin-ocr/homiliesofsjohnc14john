Recooery from sit-lmess how ιι splen-gs. 105

sending so late to them, not from any remissness, he says, HOM-
but I kept Timothy with me, because Ι had no one else, (as IX.
he had written, I hare no one likenn'nded‚) and Epaphroditus
through his sickness. He then shews that this was a long
sickness, and had consumed much time, by adding, for
he was sicle wiylc meto death. Yon see how anxious Paul
is to cut off from his disciples all occasion of slighting or
contempt, and every suspicion that he came not because
he despised them. For nothing has such power to draw a
disciple toward one, as the persuasion that his superior
cares for him, and that he is full of heaviness on his
account, for this is the part of exceeding love. Ye leave
heard, he says, that he was sicle, for he was sicle uiylc unio
death. And that these words are no excuse, hear what
follows. But God had mercy on him. that sayest thou, O
heretic? Here it is written, that God’s mercy retained and
brought back again him who was on the point of departure.
And yet if the world is evil, it is no mercy to leave a man in
the evil. Our answer to the heretic is easy, but what shall
we say to the Christian? for heg perchance will question,
and say, isto depart and to be wille Cleo-isc is far better, how
saith he that he hath obtained mercy? Ι would rather ask
why the same Apostle says, that io abide in the flesh is
more weeclfulfor you? For as this was needful for him, so
too for this man, who would hereafter depart to God with
more exceeding riches, and greater boldness. Hereaster
that would take place, even if it did not now, but the win-
ning souls is at an end for those who have once departed
thither. In many places 100, Paul speaks according to
the common habits of his hearers, and not every where in
accordance with 1115 own heavenly wisdom: for he had to
speak to men of the world who still feared death. Then he
shews how he esteemed Epaphroditus, and thence he gets
for him respect, by saying, that his preservation was so
useful to himself, that the mercy which had been shewn to
Epaphroditus reached him also. Moreover, without this the
present life is a good3 were it not so, why does Paul rank
with punishment untimely deaths? as when he says, Fori Cor.
