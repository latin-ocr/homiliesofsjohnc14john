salvation wilhsear and trembliny;' sor it is impossible for
one, who lives devoid of sear, to set forth any high or com-
manding example3 and he said not merely wzftlzfear, but he
added, and witlz trembliny, which is au excessive degree of
sear, as he was desirous to make them take the better heed.
Such fear had Paul: and therefore he said, I sear lest haviny lCor.9,
pereae-hed to others, I rnyself should be a castate-ay. For if27'
without the aid of sear temporal things can never be achieved,
how much less spiritual matters3 for I desire to know, who
ever learnt his letters without sear? who ever became a pro-
ficient in any art, without sear? But if, when the devil does
not lie in the way, where indolence is the only obstacle, so
much of sear is necessary merely in order that we may master
that indolence which is natural to us; where there is so fierce
a war, so great hindranceS, how can we by any possibility be
saved without sear?

And how may this sear be produced? If we but consider
that God is every where present, that He heareth all things,
that He seeth all thingS, not only whatsoever is done and
said, but also all that is in the heart, and in the depth of the
soul, for He is α Discerner of the tleoufflats and intents (gf the Heb. 4,

imagine aught that is evil. For, tell me, if thou hadst to
stand constantly near the person of a ruler, wouldest not
thou stand there with sear? and how standing in God's
presence, (lost thou laugh and throw thyself back, and not
conceive sear and dread? Let it never bc that thou de-
spisest His long-suffering, for it is to bring thee to repentance
that He is longsuffering3 and when thou doest aught,
never allow thyself to do it, without being sensible that God
is present in all things, for He 2⁹8 present. So then whether
eating, or preparing to slcep, or giving way to passion, or
robbing another, or whatever thou art about, consider that
God is standing by, and thou wilt never be led into laughter‚
never be inflained with rage. If this be thy thought con-
tinually, thou wilt continually be in sear and tremblz'ny, for-
asmuch as thou art standing beside the King. The builder,
though he be experienced, though he be perfectly master of
his art, yet stands with sear and trembliny, lest he fall down
