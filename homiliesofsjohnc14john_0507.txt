Let us not remember the kingdom 50 much as hell. For Hom.
sear has more power 111311 1116 promise. And 1 know that -L
many would despise ten thousand blessings, if they were rid
of the punishment, inasmuch as it is even now sufficient sor
me to escape vengeance, and not to be punished. No 0116,
of those who have hell before their eyes will fall into hell.

No one of those who despise hell will escape 11611. For as
among us those who sear the judgment-seats will not be
apprehended by them, but those who despise them are
chiefly those who fall under them, so is it also in this case.

If the Ninevites had not feared destruction, they would have
been 0161111101111, 11111 because they feared, they were not
overthrown. If in the time of Noah they had feared 1116
deluge, they would not have been drowned. And if the
Sodomites had feared, they would not 11316 116611 consuined

despises threatening will soon experience its reality in the
execution of it. Nothing is so profitable as to converse con-

of words, it 15 manifest 11131 we shall not be able to bear
’ affliction in very deed. If 110 0116 endures a discourse con·

0116 would ever stand firm against fire, against swerd. Let
us exercise our ears not 10 116 over soft and tender: for from
this we shall come to endure even the things themselves. If
we be habituated to hear of dreadful things, we shall be
habituated also to endure dreadfu] things, But if we be so
relaxed as not to endure even words, when shall we stand
against things? Do you see how the blessed Paul despises
all things here, and dangers one aster another. therefore ?
Because lle had been in the practice of despising 11611, sor
