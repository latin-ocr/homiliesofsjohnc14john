By these discourses let us regulate as well ourselves as our
wives too, our servants, our children, our fn‘ends, and, is possi-
ble, our enemies. For with ¹¹ these discourses we are able to
cut off the greater part of our sins, and it is better to dwell
upon things grievous than upon things agreeable, and it is
manifest from hence. For, tell me, if you should go into
a house where a marriage is celebrated, for a season you
are (lelighted at the spectacle, butasterwards having gone
away, you pine with grief that you have not so 11111011ῑ. But
if you enter the house of mourners, even though they are
very rich, when you go away you will be rather resreshed.
For there you have not conceived envy, but comfort and con-
solation in your poverty. You have seen by facts, that riches
are no good, poverty no evil, but they are things indifferent.
So also now, if you talk about luxury, you the more vex
your soul, that is not able perhaps to be luxurious. But
if you are speaking against luxury, and introduce discourse
by the way concerning hell, the thing will cheer you, and
beget much pleasure. For when you consider that luxury
will not be able to defend us at all against that fire, you will
not seek after it; but if you reflect that it is wont to kindle it
even more, you will not only not seek, but will turn from
it and reject it.

Let us not then avoid discourses concerning hell, that wc
may avoid hell. Let us not banish the remembrance of pu-
nishment, that we may escape punishment. lf the rich man
had reflected upon that fire, he would not have sinned; but
because he never was minslful of it, therefore he fell into it.
Tell me, O man, being about to stand before the J udgment-
seat of Christ, dost thou speak of any thing rather than of
that? And when you have a matter before ajudge, perhaps
only relating to words k, neither day nor night, at no time or
season dost thou talk of any thing else, but always of that
