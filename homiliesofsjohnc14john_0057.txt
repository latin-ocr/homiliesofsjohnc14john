tonyzce,f0r I am scorelaed in tlzisflame. For although that
rich man had endured none of the things Ι have men-
tioned, though he had passed his whole life without dread
and care—why say I his whole life ? rather that one moment,

pared with that eternity which has no end,)—though all things αἰὼν, Β·
had turned out according to his desire, must he not be pitiedss οῖ’
for these words, yea rather for these realities? XVas not your
table once deluged with wine ? Now you are not master even
of 3 drop of water, and that 100, 111 your greatest need. Did
not you neglect that poor man sull of sores? But now you
ask a sight of him, and no one gives leave. He lay at your
gate. But now in Abraham's bosom. You then lay under
your lofty ceiling. But now in the fire of hell.

These things let the rich men hear. Yea rather not the rich, (5)
but the pitiless. Fornot in that he was rich was he punished,
but because he shewed 110 pity; for it is possible that a man
who is at the same time rich and pitisul,sh ould meet with every
good. And for this cause the rich man's eyes were fixed on
no one else, but on him alone, who then begged his alins,
that he might learn from memory of his former actions, that
his punishment was just. XVere there not ten thousand poor
men who were righteous? But he, who then lay at his gate,
alone is seen by him, to instruct him and 113, how great a
good it is to put no trust in riches. His poverty hinde1·ed
not the one in obtaining the kingdom. His riches helped
not the other to avoid hell. Where is the point at which 3
man is poor? where is the point at which he is reduced to
beggaryi? He is not, he is not poor, who has nought, but
116 who desires many things! He is not rich who has large
possessions‚but he who stands in need of nothing. For what
prositis there to possess the whole world, and yet live in
more despair than he who has nothing. Their dispositions
make men rich and poor, not the abundance or the want of
money. would you, who are a poor man, become rich?
