was superfluous for him to wn'te, who would almost overtake
the letter. For he says, Ht’m thet-(glore I hope lo send pre-
sently. But hcre it was not so3 but he had just retumcd
to him, so that he naturally joined in the lenm-¹. For 110
says, Now when Timotheus came from you unio us. But
why does he place Silvanus before him, though he testifies
to his numberless good qualities, and prefers him above all ?
Perhaps Timothy wished and requested him to do so from
his great humility3 for when he saw his master so humble-
minded, as to associate his disciple with himself, 110 would
much the more have desired this. For he says,

Paul, and Silvanm, and Timotheus, ‘emto tlte Church os tlze
Thessalonians. Here he gives himself no title—not ‘ an Apo-
stle,' not ‘ a Servant,’ Ι suppose, because the men were newly
instructed, and had not yet had any experience of him ¹', he
does not mention his rank, and at any rate, it was as yet the
beginning of his preaching to them.

To the Church of tlte leesscclonians‚ he says. And well.
For since it is probable there were feW, and they not yet
formed into a body, on this account he consoles them with
the name of the Church. For where much time had passed,
and the congregation of the Church was large, he does not
apply this term. But because the name of the Church is a
name of multitude, and of a system now compacted, on this
account he calls them by that name.

In God the Fatlzer, 110 says, and tlte Lord Jeszcs Christ.
Unto the Church of llze Τήθεεαίοφιὶαηε, 110 says, wlzielz is in
God. Behold again the expression, inc, applied both to
the Father and to the Son. But he says, in God, because
there were many asscmblies d, both Jewish and Grecian. It
is a great dignity, and to which there is nothing equal, that
it is in God. God grant therefore that this Church may
be so addressed! But I fear that it is far from that
appellation. For if any one is the servant of sin, hc cannot
be said to be in God, (if any one walks not according to
God, he cannot be said to be in God0.)
