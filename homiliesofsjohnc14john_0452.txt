houses. And, although they committed fornication, yet it
wasjust after they came out of the evils of Egypt, and had
hardly heard of such a law. But we do it, having previously
received from our forefathers the doctrine of salvation‚ so that
we are deserving of greater punishment.
Would you hear also of other things? what were their
sufferings in Palestine‚ famines, pestilenceS, captivities, under
the Babyloniam, and under the Assyrians, and their miseries
from the Macedonians, and those under Hadrian and Vespa-
sian? I have something that I wish, beloved, to relate to
thee3 nay, do not run away¹ ! I will rather tell thee another
thing before it. There was once a famine, it says, and the
king was walking upon the wall; then a woman came to him
From and uttered these words: ‘ O king, this woman said to me,
{lggngs Let us roast thy son to-day, and eat him—to-morrow mine.
' ⁸ And we roasted and ate, and now she does not give me her's.'

suffered such punishment, and shall we not much rather

over Josephus, and you will learn that whole tragedy‚ if
perchance we may persuade you srom these things, that there
is a hell. For consider, if they were punished, why are we
not punished? or how is it reasonable that we are not now
punished, who sin more grievously than they? Is it not
manifest that it is, because the punishment is kept in store
for us? And, if you please, I will tell you in the person of
every individual how they were punished. Cain murdered
his brother. A horrible sin indeed, who can deny it? But
he suffered punishment, and a heavy one, equivalent to ten
thousand deaths, sor he would rather have died ten thousand
