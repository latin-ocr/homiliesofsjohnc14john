The Son ‘ before all θάνῃς] 215

having said in Him, he added, by Him. But what is for Pffiw·
Him? Itis this3 the subsistence of all things depends on ’ ·
Him. Not only did He Himself bring them out of nothing

into being, but Himself sustains¹ them now, so that were ¹⁶¹gwe2·
they dissevered from His Providence, they were at once un— ‘m'
done and destroyed. But He said not, ⁴ He continues them,’

which had been a grosser way of speaking, but what is more
subtle, that on Him they hang. For to have only a bearing

on Him is enough to continue any thing and bind it fast.

 

So also the word firstborn is said as foundation is2. But2 or per-
this doth not shew the creatures to be consubstantial with ξξξξθᾏξζ

Him 3 but that all things are by Him, and in Him. So also of a
when he says elsewhere, I have laid a foundation, he isicj’gfffia'
speaking not concerning substance, but operation. For, {offis-3²
that thou mayest not think Him to be a minister, he says ’
that He continues them, which is not less than making

them. Certainly, with us it is greater even t for to the former,

art conducts us3 but to the latter, not so; for it stayeth not

a thing in decay.

And He is before all tlzinyS, he saith. This is befitting
God. Where is Paul of Samosata ? And in Him all tlzz'nys
consist, that is, they are created into Him. He repeats these
expressions in close sequence3 with their close succession,
as it were with rapid strokes, tearing up the deadly doctrine
by the roots. For, if even when such great things had been
declared, still after so long a time Paul of Samosata sprung
up, how much more [would such have been the case], had not
these things been said before? And in Him, he saith, all
thiu-qs consist. How ‘ consist' in one who was not? So that
the things also done by Angels are of Him.

And He is the lzead of tlte body, the Olzurelz.

Having spoken of His dignity, he afterwards speaks of
His love to man also. He is, saith he, tlze Head of tlze body,
tlte Clzurcla. He said not Qf tlze fielnes-s g, (although this
too is asserted in what he says,) out of a wish to shew His
great sriendliness to us, in that He who is thus above, and

above all, connected Himself with those below. For every
