HOMILY VIII.

PHIL. ii. 12—16.

Whenfore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in
my presence only, buc now much more in my absence, work
out your own salvation with sear ancl tremblz’ny. For it
is God which worlceth in you botlz to will and to clo of His
qoodpleasure. Do all tlzz'nys without murmurmqs and
disputinqs: that με may be blameless and harmless, tlze
sons of God, without rebuke, in the miclst of a croolced and
perverse walion, among] wlwm με εἰιίηθ as lz‘ylzts in tlze
world ; lcola'ioijbrtlz tlte word (gf lffe; tlzat I may rqjoice
in tlze clay of Christ.

THE admonitions, which we give, ought to be accompanied
with commendations, for thus they become even welcome,
when we refer those, whom we admonish, to that measure of
zeal which they have themselves exhibited3 as Paul, for
instance, did here3 and observe with what singular discretiom
Wherefine, my beloz’ecl, he says3 he did not say simply ‘ be
obedient‚’ not until he had first commended them in these
words, as ye leave alu-(lys obeyed; i. e. ‘ it is not other men,
but your own selves, whom Ι bid you take example by,’ and
why, much more 2⁰72 my absence? ‘ ΥΘ seemed perhaps at
that time to be doing every thing out of respect to me, and
srom a principle of shame, but that is no longer so3 if then ye
make it evident that ye now strive more earnestly, it is also
made evident that neither then was it done out of considera—
tion to me, but sor God's sake) Tell me, what wouldest thou?
