commandments and the statutes. For no longer from the Hom.
constraint of a teacher, but from their own voluntary choice, V.

only what is thrown upon it, so too ought the soul not to
stop at those things which have been inculcated, but even to
go beyond them. Do you see that he has properly said ⁶ to
go‘beyondb? For virtue is divided into these two things, to
decline from evil, and to do good. For the retreating from
evil is not sufficient for the arrival at virtue, but it is a kind
of path, and a beginning leading theret03 still we have
need of great alacrity. The things therefore to be avoided
he tells them in the order of commandment And justly,
For these things indeed being done bring punishment, but

in many places, both in his Epistle to the Romans, and in all
his Epistles. For in truth this is an evil pernicious to all.
And as a swine full charged with mire, wherever he enters,
