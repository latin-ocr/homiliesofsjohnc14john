how should he ask for future things, who is not thankful sor
the past? But iu all, he saith, that 16, 111 every thing-¹, with
prayer ‹1chsnpplicaliou. W'heresore we ought to give thanks
for all things, even sor those which seem to he grievous, for
this is the part of the truly thankful man. In the other case
the nature of the thing demands it; but this springs from a
grateful soul, and one earnestly affected toward God. God
acknowledgeth these prayers, but others He lznoweth not.
Wherefore offer up such prayers as may he acknowledged,
for He disposeth all things sor our profit, though we know it
not. And this is a proof that it greatly profiteth, namely,
that we know it not. And the peace (ψ’ God ‘which pass-ella

This is the part of a teacher, not only to exhort, but also to
pray, and to assist by supplication, that they may neither be
overwhelmed by telnptation, nor carried about by deceit. As
if he had said, May He Who hath delivered you in such sort
as mind cannot comprehend, may He Himselfguard you, pre-
serve yOU, so that you suffer no ill. Either, then, he means
