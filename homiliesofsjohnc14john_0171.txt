Christ crowns above. Perfeotz‘on in humility. 141

111 comparison with that prize, precious stones are mere Ιὶίζῗῗῐ
bric-ks in comparison with its beauty. If thou hast this, and '
takest thy departure to heaven, thou wilt be able to walk
there with great honour; the angels will reverence thee, when
thou bearest this prize, with much confidence wilt thou ap—
proach them all. Iu, Christ JesuS, see the humility of his
mind3 this I do, saith he, in Christ Jesus, for it is impossible
without His assistance to pass over so vast an interval: we
have need of much aid, of a mighty alliance3 He hath willed
that thou shouldest struggle below, on high He crowns thee.
Not as in this world3 the crown is not there, where the con-
test is3 but this crown is in that bright place. See ye not,
even here, that the most honoured of the wrestlers and cha-
rioteers are not crowned in the course below, but the king calls
them up, and crowns them there? Thus too is it here, in
heaven thoucl receivest the prize.

Ver. 15. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus
minded, saith he. And {fin any thiny ye be otherwise minded,
God will ret-eal even this anto you. that meaneth the word
this? That we should foryet those thinys which are behind.
VVherefore it belongs to him who is perfect not to consider
himself perfect. How therefore sayest thou, as many as are
perfect? For tell me, are we minded as thou art? For if thou
hast not attained nor art perfected, how dost thou command
those that are perfect to be so minded as thou art, who art
not yet perfect? Yea‚ for this, saith he, is perfection.
And zf ye are in any tlziwy otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even, this mtto you. That is, if any one considers that
he has attained all excellence. He puts them on their guard,
not by speaking directly, but what saith he? Isin any thiny
ye be otherwise minded, Gocl shall reveal even this meto you.
See how humbly he saith this! God shall teach you, i. e.
God shall persuade you e, not simply teach you, for Paul in—
deed taught, but God led them on. And he said not, shall
lead you on, but shall reveal, that this may rather seem to
spring from ignorance. These words were spoken not con-
cerning doctrines, but concerning perfection of lise, and our
not considering ourselves to be perfect, for he who considers
that he hath appreheuded all, hath nothing.
