evil doing extinguishes that light, whether reviling, or in· Hom.
solence, or whatever you can mention. For as in the case 3}-
of fire, every thing that is foreign to its nature is destructive
of it, but that kindles it which is congenial to it. So it is
also in the case of the g light. whatever is dry, whatever is μ
warm, whatever is fiery, kindles the flame of the Spirit. Let
us not therefore overlay it with any thing cold or damp.
For these things are destructive of it.

But there is also another explanation. There were among
them many indeed who prophesied truly, but some prophe—

signify is this, Do not, because there are false prophets
among you, on their account prohibit also these, and turn
away from them. Quench them not, that is, Despise not
proplzesysinys.

Seest thou that this is what he means by, Profe all {lein-qs?
