Heretics entrapped by St. Paul's words on the [ατο. 1-29

blotted out the words, they would have denied the Scriptura, Hom.
when they were unable at all to look it in the face. But as—XI'
in the case of fishes‚ that which cau take them is so con-
cealed that they may swim up, and does not lie open to
view; this in truth hath come to pass here too, in that the
Law hath been called loss by Paul. The Law, they say, is
called dewy by Paul, it is called loss. It was not possible to
gain Christ except I counted this as loss. All these things
induced the heretics to accept this passage, thinking it to be
favourable to them z but when they had taken it, then did he
enclose them on all sides with his nets. Lo what? say they,
when they make their attack. Lo! the Law is called loss,

is called dmry; how then do ye say, that it is of God?

But these very words are favourable to the Law, and how
they are so, shall be hence manifest. Let us attend accu-
rately to his very words. He said not, The Law is loss:
but Icauntecl it loss. But when he spake of gain, he said
not, I counted them, but they were quin. But when he
spake of loss he said, I cozmted: and this rightly3 for the
former was naturally 5ο, but the latter became so, srom my
opinion. ‘ What then? Is not the Law loss ?’ It is: but for
Christ.

‘ But now it hath become gain.' It was not counted quin,
says he, but was so: as if he had said, Consider how great a
thing it was: to bring men, brutalized in their nature, to the
shape of men. If the law had not been, grace would not
have been given. ζ Wherefore ?' Because it became a sort of
bridge3 for when it was impossible to mount on high from
a state of great abasement‚ a ladder was formed. And if he
who has ascended has no longer need of the ladder, he does
not for this reason despise it, but is grateful to it. For it has
placed him in such a position, as no longer to require it.
And yet for this very reason, that he doth not require it, it is
just, he means, that he should acknowledge his obligation,
for without it he could not have ascended. And thus is it
with the Law, it hath led us up on high3 wherefore it was gain,
but for the future we esteem it loss. ‘ How ?' Not because
it is loss, but because grace is far greater. For as a poor man,
that was in hunger, as long as he has silver, escapes hunger,
but when he finds gold, and is unable to keep both, considers
