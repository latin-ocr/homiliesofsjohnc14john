only, but here he speaks of murmurinq ancl disputinq. But
why, I want to know, when in the case of the Corinthians he
was engaged in uprooting this evil tendency, did he remind
them of thc Israelites, but here has said nothing of the sort,
but simply charged them? Because in that case the mischief
was already done, sor which reason there was need of a more
severe stroke and a sharpe1·rebuke; but here he is giving ad-
monitions to prevent its being done. Severe measures then
were not called for in order to secure those that had not yet
been guilty3 as in leading them to humility he did not subj oin
the instance in the Gospel, wherein the proud were punished,
but laid the charge as from God’s lips3 and he addresses
them as free, as children of pure birth, not as servants;
for in the practice of virtue a rightminded and generous
person is influenced by those who have done well, but one
of bad principles is not led by these, but by the example of
such as receive punishment 3 the one by the consideration of
honour, the other of chastisement. XVherefore also writiug
to the Hebrews‚ he said, bringing forward the example of
Esau, Whofor one morsel of meat sold his hiala-tylen and
again, {f any man draw bach, my sont shall have no pleasure
in him. And among the Corinthians were many who had
been guilty of fornication. Thercfore he said, And lest when
I come aqam my God will lmmble me amous] you, and that
I slmll bewail many that have sinned already, and have not
repented of the mzclemmess, andsornieation, and lascivious·
mess which theg) have committed. That ye may be blameless
and harmless ,· i. e. irreproachable, unsullied; for murmuring
occasions no slight stain. And what means without dis-
putz'ny? ‘Is it good, or not good ?’ Do not question, he
says, though it be trouble, or labour, or any thing else what-
ever. He did not say, ‘ that ye be not punished,' notwith-
standing that punishment is reserved sor the thing; and this
he made evident in the Epistle to the Corinthiam, but here
he said nothing of the sort3 but he says, That ye may be
blameless and harmles-s3 the sons of God, without rebulce, in
the midst of a croolced and perverse walion, among] whom pse
shine like liqlats in the world, holdinqsorth the word of lzfe,
that I may rejoice in the day of Christ. Observest thou
that he is instructing these not to murmur? So that murmur-
