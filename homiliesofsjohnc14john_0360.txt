Coros. And how become they one flesh? As if thou shouldest take
4' ¹⁵2 away the purest part of gold, and mingle it with other gold3
so in truth herc also the woman receiving the richest part
sused by pleasure‚ nourisheth it and cherisheth it, and withal
contributiug her own share, restoreth it back a Man. And
the child is a sort of bridge‚ so that the three become one
flesh, the child connecting, on either side, each to other. For
like as two cities, which a river divides throughout, become
one, isa bridge connect them on both sides, so is it‘ in this
case3 and yet more, for the very bridge in this case is formed
ἰι-ξ, Μ’ of the substance of each. And by this argument¹ they are
W⁷⁰¹7⁷5⁴ one, as the body and the head are one body¹3 for they are
divided by the neck3 but not divided more than connected,
for it, lying between them, brings together each with the
other, and it is the same as if a chorus that had been severed
should, by taking one part of itself from this quarter, and the
other again from the right, make one; 01· as these when come
into close rank, and extending hands, become one; for the
hands extended admit not of their being two. Therefore
to wit He said with accuracy of expression, not ⁴ they shall
² εἰς quie-be one flesh,' but mtto one flfflffl, namely, that of the child
’(ιῇζᾜ, wherein they are connected together. What then? when
{5513 there is no child, will they not be still two then? Nay, it is
Α ’ plain [they will not], for their coming together bath this effect,
diffusing and commingling the bodies of both. And as one
who bath cast ointment into oil, hath made the whole one;

so in truth is it also here.

of this is your own lasciviousness, and unchasteness. The fact
