its dissolutimi, we should have stopped their mouths. Cel·-
tainly! For is this what will stop their mouths, to know that
some time 01· other it will be destroyed, or to know when it
will be destroyed? If you wish to stop their mouths, tell
them this, that it will have an end. If they do not believe
this, neither will they believe the other.

Hear Paul saying, For yourselres know perfeclly that tlte
day (stlte Lord so comella as α Ilaez'cfffin the m'yht. Not the

impending, many have departed without lllumination‚ and
not even this fem· has taught them, whilst living, to attend to
the things that are pleasing to God3 if this sear also had
