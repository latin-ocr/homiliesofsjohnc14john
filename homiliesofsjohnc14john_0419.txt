he says, Because that llze Lord is tlte avenyer osall such. He
exhorted them first, he shamed them, saying, even as llze
Gentiles, Then from reasonings he shewed the impropriety,

and this was, to defraud a brother. Afterwards he adds the
principal thing3 Because, ho says, tlte Lord is the awayer (gf

all suelz, as we also lzavesorewarned you and testz'fled. For we

shall not do these things without being punished, neither shall

we enjoy so much pleasure, as we shall undergo punishment.

Because he had said lzis brollzem and had also added, that
God is the avenger, shewing that even if an unbeliever has
suffered this, he who has done it shall suffer punishment, he
has spoken thus. And this is what he says; It is not as avcnging
him that He will punish thee, but‘² because thou hast insulted
Himself. He Himself called thee, thou hast insulted Him
Who called thee. On this account, he has added,

Ver. 8. He therefore llzat (lespisetlc, despiseth not man, but

So that whether thou shouldest defile the Empress, he says,
or even thine own handmaid, that hath a husband, the crime
is the same. Why? Because He avenges not the persons
that are injured, but Himself. For thou art equally dcsiled,
thou hast equally insulted G0d3 for both the one and the
other is adultery, as both tho one and the other is marriage.
And though thou shouldest not commit adultery, but fornica-

will avenge, for He avenges Himsclf. For thou dost this act,
not despising the man f, so much as God. Auditis manifest
from hence: for thou doest it concealing it from man, 'out
thou pretendest that God doth not see thee. For tell me, if
one who was thought worthy of the purple, and of infinite
honour from the king, and was commanded to live suitably
to the honour, should go and defile himself with any woman;
whom has he insulted? hor, or the king who gave him all?
She indeed is insulted ton, but not equally.

to avenge thine own selfi’
