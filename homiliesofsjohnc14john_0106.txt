Now learn what this meaneth. thatsoever a man robs,
and takes contrary to his right, he dares not lay aside, from
sear lest it perish, and fall froin his possession, but he keeps
hold of it continually. He who possesses a dignity which is
natural to him, sears not to descend from that (lignity, being
assured that nothing of this sort will huppen to him. As
for example, Absalom usurped the govermnent, and dared
not afterwards to lay it aside. We will go to another exam-
ple, but if example cannot present the whole matter to yon,
take it not amiss, for this is the nature of examples, they
leave the greater part for the imagination to reason out. A
man rebels against his sovereign, and usurps the kingdom:
he dares not lay aside or conceal the matter, for if he once
put it away, straightway it is gone. Let us take another
example3 if a man takes any thing violently, he keeps firm
hold os it continually, sor if he lay it down, he straightway
loses it3 and generally speaking they who have ought by
rapine, are afraid to lay it by, or put it away, or not to keep
constantly in that state which they have assumed. Not so
they, who have possessions not proeured by rapine, as Man,
who possesses the dignity of being a reasonable being. But
here exaniples fail me, sor there is no natural preeminenee
amongst us, for no good thing is naturally our own, since
they all are inherent in1 the nature of God. What do we
say then? That the Son of God seared not to descend from
His right, sor he thought not Deity a matter of robbery, He
was not afraid that any would strip Him of that nature or
that right, wherefore He laid it¹' aside, being confident that
He should take it up again. He hid it, knowing that He
was not made inferior by so doing. For this eause, Paul says
not, ‘⁴ He seized not,'’ but He llaeouylet tt not robbery, for He
possessed not that estate by robbery, but it was natural, not
eonserred⁰, it was enduring and sase. therefore He refused
not to take the form of an inferior ⁰. The tyrant fears to lay
