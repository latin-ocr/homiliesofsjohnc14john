What fountain wilt thou compare to these tears? That in (3)
Paradise, which watereth the whole earth? But thou wilt
have mentioned nothing like it. For this fount ostears watered
souls, not earth. If one were to shew us Paul bathed in
tears, and groauing, would not this be better far to see, than
countless choirs gaily erowned? I am not now speaking of
you, but, if one, having pulled away from the theatre and
the stage some wanton fellow, burning and drunken with
carnal love, were to shew him a young virgin in the very
flower of her age, surpassing her fellows, both in other
respects, and in her sace more than the rest of her person,
having an eye, tender and soft, that gently‘ resteth, and
gently rolleth, moist, mild, calmly smiling, and arrayed in
much modesty and much grace, fringed with dark lashes
both under and over, having an eyeball, so to speak, alive, a
forehead radiant3 underneath, again, a cheek shaded to exact
redness, lying smooth as marble, and even3 and then any
one should shew me Paul weeping3 leaving that maiden, I
would have eagerly sprung away to the sight of him ; for
from his eyes there beamed spiritual beauty. For that other
transporteth the souls of youths, it scm-cheth and inflameth
them; 'but this, on the contrary, subdueth them. Whoso
gazeth upon his eyes, thereby maketh that of his soul more
beauteous, he curbeth his belly3 he filleth himself with the
love of wisdom, with much sympathy z this¹ is able to soften ¹ q Mss.
even a soul of adamant. With these tears the Church is* ⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰
watered, with these souls are planted3 yea, though there be
fire sensible and substantial, yet can these tears quench it;
these tears quench the fiery darts of the wicked one.

Remember we then these tears of his, and we shall laugh
to scorn all present things. These tears did Christ pro-
nounce blessed, saying, Blessed are they {leat mourn, and Matt.5‚
blessed are they that weep,jbr they shall lauyla. Such tea1·s‘{juke 6
