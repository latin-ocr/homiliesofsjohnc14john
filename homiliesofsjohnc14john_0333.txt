Eartlely ornaments are chains of sin. 303

not giving way under his bonds, dot-h not behold a spectacle Hom.
of earth, but one worthy of the heavens. The soul that is in X·
that way attired looks about‚—who hath seen? who not seen ,Ρ-

is filled with pride, is possessed with anxious thoughts, is
bound with countless other passions: but he that hath these
bonds on him, is without pride: his soul exulteth, is freed from

every anxious care, is joyous, hath its gaze on heaven, is

clad with vvings. If any one were to give me the choice of
seeing Paul either stooping¹ out of heaven, and uttering his ¹3¹oex15-
voice, or out of the prison, I would choose the prison. For ποντα
they'2 of heaven visit him when he is 111 1110 prison. The²aL⁴ds3

 

bonds of Paul were the cementing of the Gospel³, that chain ἓὲῗθγ
of his was its foundation. Long we for those bonds! Procla-

And how, doth any say, may this be? If we break up and (5)
dash in pieces these. No good results to us from these bonds,
but even harm. These will shew us as prisoners There3 but
the bonds of Paul will loose those bonds: she that is bound
with these here, with those deathless bonds shall she also be
bound There, both hands and feet3 she that is bound with
Paul's, shall have them in that day as it were an ornament
about her. Free both thyself fron] thy bonds, and the poor
man from his hunger. Why rivetest thou fast the chains of
thy sins? Some 0110 saith, How? then thou wearest gold
whilst another is perishing, when thou, to get thee vainglory,
takest so much gold, whilst another has not even what to
eat, hast thou not wedged fast thy sins? Put Christ about
thee, and not gold; where Mammon is, there Christ is not,
where Christ is, there Mammon is not. Wouldest not thou
put on the King of all Himself? If one had offered thee the
purple, and the diadem, wouldest thou not have taken them
before all the gold in the world? I give thee not the regal
ornaments, butI offer thee to put on the King Himself. And
how can one put Christ on, (loth any say? Hear Paul
saying, As many of you as leave been baptized into Christ‚Ga1· 3,
have put on Christ. Hear the Apostolical precept, Malce not 5125}le
provision sor the flesli to fulfll tlze lusts tlzereqf. Thus doth ¹4·
one put on Christ, if one provide not for the flesh unto its
lust. If thou have put 011 Christ, even the devils will fearxqmszv
thee, but if gold, even men will laugh thee to scorn: if thou ’cem'
have put 011 Christ, men also will reverence thee.
