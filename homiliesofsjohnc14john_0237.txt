This caused by an evil conscience. 207

impiety has not even consistency 3 to confess Him to be HOM-
God, and yet not to think Him worthy of belief in what He 11.
has said3 these are the words of drunkenness, of luxury, of riot.
Let us eat (md drink,f0r to-morrow we die. Not to-mor- {5023}-
row; but now ye are dead, when ye thus speak. Shall we then ’ ’
be in nothing different from swine and asses? tell me. For
if there be neither a judgment, nor a retribution, nor a tri—
bunal, wherefore have we been honoured with such a gift as
reason, and have all things put under us? Why do we rule,
and are they ruled? See how the devil is on every side urgent
to persuade us to be ignorant of the Gift of God. He mixes
together the slaves with their masters, like some man-stealere
and ungrateful servant, he strives to degrade the free to the
level of the criminal. And he seems indeed to be overthrow-
ing the J udgment, but he is overthrowing the being of Gode.

For such is ever the devil's way3 he puts forward every
thing artfully, and not in a straightforward manner, to put
us on our guard. If there is no J udgment, God is not-just:
(I speak as a man,) if God is not just, then there is no God
at all: if there is no God, all things go on at haphazard,
virtue is nought, vice nought. But he says nothing of this
openly. Seest thou the drift of this satanical argument?
how, instead of men, he wishes to make us brutes, or rather,
wild beasts, or rather, demons. Let us then not be persuaded
by him. For there is a J udgment, O wretched and miserable
man! Ι know whence· thou comest to use such words. Thou
hast committed many sins, thou hast offended‚ thou hast no
confidence ², thou thinkest that the nature of things will even²foef³fin=
follow thy arguments. Meanwhile, saith he, Ι will not tor-‘⁷¹²⁷‘
ment my soul with the expectation of hell, and, if there be a
hell, I will persuade it that there is none3 meanwhile Ι will
live here in luxury ! Why dost thou add sin to sin? [f
when thou hast sinned thou believest that there is a 11611, thou
wilt depart with the penalty of thy sins only to pay3 but if
thou add this further impiety, thou wilt also for thino impiety,
and for this thy thought, suffer the uttermost punishment 3 and
what was a cold and shortlived comfort to thee, will be a
ground for thy being punished for ever. Thou hast sinned:
be it so: why dost thou encourage others also to sin, by say-
