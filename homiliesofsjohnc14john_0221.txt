that there indeed the pleasure arising from the quality of
the food is cancelled by the dishonour which precedes, and

the discomfort which follows the surfeit. For not less 111011
hunger doth surfeiting destroy and rack our bodies, but
even far more grievously3 and whomsoever you like to give
me, l shall more easily destroy by 1101-31103 him with surfeit
than by hunger. For, in 110111, 1110 latter is 003101· 10 be

for twenty days, but surfeiting not for as many as two only.

the other to him who inviteth them, as well? for this is
what we are enquiring after rather. Now he who invites
those makes preparation many days before, and is forced
to have trouble and anxious thoughts and cares, neither
sleeping by night, nor resting by day3 but forming With
himself many plans, conversing with cooks‚ confectioners,
deckers of tables. Then when the very day is come, one
may see him in greater sear than those who are going to
fight a boxing match, lest aught should turn out other than
