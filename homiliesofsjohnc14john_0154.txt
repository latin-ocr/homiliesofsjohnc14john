age? How irrational then to wish to return to our former
youth, and gladly to give every thing for the sake of this,
that we might become younger, and yet when it is ours to
receive a youth that knows no old age, a youth too, which,
joined with great riches, hath far more of spirit, to be unwil-
ling to give up a little trifle, but to hold fast things that con-
tribute not a whit to the present life. They ean never rescue
you from death, they have no power to drive away disease,
to stay old age, or any one of those events, which happen by
necessity and according to the law of nature. And do you
still hold to them ? Tell me, what do you gain ? Theresrom
come drunkenness‚ gluttony, pleasures contrary to nature and
various in kind, which are far worse torturers than the hardest
masters.

These are the advantages which we gain from riehes, nor
is there one besides, since we are not so minded, sor if we
had had the mind, we might have won heaven itselfsor our in-
heritance by our riches. ‘ So then riehes are good,' he says.
It is not liches, but the will ot the possessor that effects this,
for that it is the will that does it, see from hence3 it is in the
power even of a poor man to win heaven. For, as I have
often said, God does not regard the amount of the gifts, but
the will of the givers; it is possible even for one in poverty,
who has given but little, to bear off all, for God requires a
measure proportioned to our ability, neither will rie-hes secure
heaven to us, nor poverty, hell; but a good or a bad will,
either one or the other, This then let us correct, this let us
resto e, this· l t us regulate, and all will then be easy to uS.

For as the artifieer works the wood the same, whether his
axe be of iron or of gold, rather he does it the better with an
implement of iron, so here too, the straight path os virtue is
more easily kept in a state of poverty. For touchiug riehes
Christ says, It is easierfor a camel to 90 tlzroust tlte eye
of a ozeeclle, tlccmsor α ric-le man to emer into the kin-(salom (ff
Heaven. But He has made no such declarations about
poverty 3 nay, the very reverse. Sell thy yoocls, <md [five to
