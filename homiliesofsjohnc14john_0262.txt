232 Israeliles like chilcbren preferriny to be as slaves.

Hast thou seen famine? Remember that it was He that
destroyed the crops ¹! Hast thou seen wars? Remember the
drowning! Hast thou seen that they are mighty who inhabit
the land ? ssut not mightier than the Egyptians. Then He
who took thee out os the midst of them, will He not much
inore save thee when out? But they knew not how to
answcr their letters 0111 os order2, and· therefore they were
beaten. T hey ale, and drank, and lac-leod. WVhen fed with
their manna they ought not to have asked for luxury, seeing
they had known the evils which proceed from it. And they
acted precisely as if a child of honourable condition, when
sent to school, should ask to pass his time with the servants,
and to wait on them, and when receiving all needful
sustenanco, and such as becomes a free person, and sitting
at his father's table, should have a longing for the ill-savoured
and noisy one of the servants. So did these also seek after
Egypt, and said to Moses, Yea, Lord, all that thou least
said will ece do, ancl be obedienta And as it happens
in the case of very incorrigible children, that when the
father would put them to death ¹¹, the schoolmaster persever-
ingly entreats for them, the same was the case at that time
also.

Why have we said these things? Because we differ in
nothing from children. Wilt thou hear their doctrines also,
how they are those of children ? Eye for eye, it is said, and
tootlc for tootlz. With reason3 for nothing is so eager to
revenge as a childish mind. For seeing it is a passion of
irrationality, and there is much irrationality, and great lack
of consideration in that age, no wonder the child is tyran-
nized over by anger; and so great is the tyranny of anger, that
osttilnes aster stumbling and getting up again, he will smite
his knee for passion, or overturn the footstool‚ and so will
allay his pain, and quench his rage. In some such way as
this did God also deal with them, when He allowed them to
striko 0111 Eye fW' eye, (md tootle.sb1· tootle, and destroyed
tho Egyptians and the Amalekites that grieved them. And
lle promises such things, as if to one who said, ‘ Father, such
and such an one has beaten me,' the father should reply,

h ἀνιλιῖν. Perhaps he means no more than to renounee or disinherit, as he
said abore. See p. ⁴231.
