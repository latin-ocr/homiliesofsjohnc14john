Tlae poor not to be lzarshly reprovedfhr beyyiny. 507

Then again he says, tleac Ite may be aslcamed. Thus he HOM-
does not permit them to proceed farther. For as he had V.
said, {f any would not work neither should lae eat, feariug
lest they should perish by hunger, he has added, im doing!
qood, be ozot sese wem’y. Thus having said, Withdmw your-
wives, and leave πο company urim him, then fearing lest this
very thing might cut him off from the brotherhood—-for he
who gives himself up to despair, will quickly be lost if he is
not admitted to freedom of conversation—he has added,

Ver. 15. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish
him as ιι brother.

By this he shews that he has assigned a heavy punishment
against him, in depriving him of freedom of conversation.

For if to be a receiver even with many others is worthy (3)
of disgrace, when they even reprove whilst they offer it, and
withdraw themselves, how great is the reproach. For if only
giving rather tardily, and with lnurrnuring, they inflame the

and lamenting. Let us bestow therefore with the disposition
of a brother, let us admonish with the good will of a brother,
not as if we grieved at giving, but as if we grieved for his
transgressing the commandment. Since what is the advan-
tage? For if, even after giving, you insult, you destroy the
pleasure of giving. But when you do not give aud yet insult,
what wrong do you not do to that wretched and unfortunate
man? He came to you, to receive pity from you, but he
goes away having received a deadly blow, and weeps the
more. For when by reason of his poverty he is compelled
to beg, and is insulted on account of his begging, think how
great will be the punishment of those who insult him. He Prov.
