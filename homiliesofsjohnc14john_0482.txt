452 How to keep 11ιο Lamp qs 11ιο Spe-it aliyht.

{THES- from some other (11101101- has vehemently assailed it, as some
³le wind, and if the light be not strong, or it has not much oil,

or you have not closed the opening, 01· have not shut the
door, all 18 1111110110. But what is the opening? As in the

- lamp, so is it also in ns: the opening is the eye and the ear.

Snffer not a violent blast of wiekedness to sall upon these,
since it would extinguish the lamp, but close them up with
the sear os God. The mouth is the door. Shut it, and
fasten it, that it may both give light, and repe] the attack
from without. For instance, has any one insulted and reviled
you? Do you shut the mouth. For if you open it, you add
force to the wind. Do you not see in houscs, when two
doors stand direetly opposite, and there is a strong wind,
how, if you shut one, and there is no opposite draught, the
wind has no power, but the greater part of its force is abated?
So also now, there are two doors, thy mouth, and his who
insults and affronts thee3 if thou shuttest thy mouth, and
dost not allow a draught on the other side, thou hast qnenched
the whole blast3 but if thou openest it, it will not be re-
strained. Let 118 not therefore quench it ‘¹.

And the flame is often 1101110 to be extinguished even when
nothing assails it. then the 011 faits, when we do not alins ⁹,
the Spirit, is quenehed. For it came to thee as an ahns¹ from
God. Then He sees this fruit not existing in thee, and flies
away. For 110 0111ᾶο8 not with an unmerciful 80111. But the
Spirit being quenched, ye know what follows, as many of you
as have walked in a moonless night. And if it 18 difficult
to walk by night in a road from land to land, how 18 it safe
in the road that leads from earth to heaven? Know ye not
how many demens there are in the intervening space, how
many wild beasts, how many spirits of wickedness? If indeed
we have that light, they will not be able to hurt 118; but if
we extinguish it, they 80011 take us captive, they soon rob us
of every thing. Since even robbers first extinguish the lamp,
and then plunder us. For they indeed see in this darkness,
since they do the works of darkness: but we are unac-
customed to that light‘. Let us not then extinguish it. All
