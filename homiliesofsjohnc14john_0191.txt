Vice an enemy lo om· nature. 161

heard and seen in me, i. e. with me. As if he had said, I Hom.
have led you forward both by deeds and by words. These XIV.
tlzinys do, not only say them, but do them also. And the God

of peace shall be m'tlz you, i. e. if ye so guard these things,

and are at peace one toward another, ye shall be in a calm,

in great safety, ye shall suffer nothing painsul, nor contrary to

your will. For when we are at peace with Him, and we are

so through virtue, much more will He be at peace with us.

For He who so lox-ed 113, as to shew favour to 113 even against

our will, will He not, if He sees us hastening toward Him,
Himself yet much more exhibit His love toward us?

Nothing is such an enemy of our nature as vice. And from Monir„

many things it is evident, how vice is at enmity with 113, and
virtue friendly toward us. And if ye will, let us consider this
first, from one of the opposites, i. e. fornication. Fornication
makes men subject to reproach, poor, objects of ridicule,
despicable to all, treating 1110111 as an enemy doth. Ofttimes
it hath involved men in disease and danger 3 many men have
perished or been wounded, by reason of their mistresses; but
if fornication produces these things,much rather doth adultery.
But doth almsgiving so? By no means. But as a loving
mother setteth her son in great propriety, in good order, in
good report, and gives him lcisure to engage in necessary
work, thus almsgiving (10111 1101 101 113 go, nor lead us away
from our necessary work, but even renders the 30111 more
wise. For nothing is more foolish than a mistress.

But what willest thou ? To look upon eovetousness ? It
too treats 113 like an enemy. And how? It makes us hatcd
by all. It prepareth all men to vaunt themselves against us.

Both those who have been treated unjustly by 113, and those
who have not, who share the grief of the former, and are in
fear for themselves. All men look upon us as their common
foes, as wild beasts, as demons. Every where are there
innumerable accusations, plots against us, envyings‚ all which
are thc acts of enemies. But justice, on the contrary, makes
all men fn‘ends, all men sociable‚ all men well disposed to—
wards us: our affairs are straightway in perfect safety, there is
no danger, there is no suspicion. But sleep also fearlessly
comes over us with perfect sascty, no care is there, no la-
menting.
