Reconciliation throuyh Christ, and how. 217

Godhead, like as John said, Of His ⁸fielness have all we HOM-
received. That is, whether it were the Son or the VVord, HL
THERE dwelt ¹¹¹, not a sort of energy, but a Substance.

He hath no cause- ἑο assign but the will of God: for this
is the import' of, z't pleased . . . in, Htm. Ami . . . by Him
to reeonez‘le all thina? emto Himsegf. Lest thou shouldest
think that He undertook the office of a minister only, he
saith, anto¹ Himseff. And yet he elsewhere says, that He2Cor·5‚
reconciled us to God, as in the Epistle he wrote to the nigra-,230
Corinthians. And he well said, By Him to make an end (ff i} e. into'
‘recolat-ilinq “. For they were already reconciled3 but it was ῗῑῒῃῗέῗχ
necessary that they should be so completely, and in such
sort, as no more to be at enmity with Him. And how this
is effected, he next⁰ makes very clear, deducing not only the
reconciliation, but also the manner of the reconciliation.
Hariny made peace throecyle the Blood (gf His Cross. The
word reeoncz'le, shews the eumity3 the words haviny made
peace, the war. Throuyla the Blood of His Cross, by Himself,
whether thinys in earth, οφ· thinys in heaven. A great thing
indeed it is to reconcile; but that this should be by Himself
too, is a greater thing. A greater still, that it should be through
His B100d; and he said not simply His Blood, but what is
yet greater, through the Cross. So that the marvels are five :
He reconciled us3 to God3 hy Himself3 by Death3 by the
Cross. Admirable again! How he has mixed them up!
For lest thou shouldest think that it is one thing merely, or
that the Cross is any thing of itselff‘, he saith by He'mseff.
How knew he ‘¹ that this was a great thing? Because not by
speaking words, but by giving Himself up for the recon-
ciliation‚ He so wrought every thing.

But what is thiu-qs in heaven? For with reason indeed is
it said, the thingys in« earth, sor those were filled with enmity,
and manifoldly divided, and each one of us was utterly at
variance with himself, and with the many3 but how made

He peace amongst the lhinys in heaven? Was war and
