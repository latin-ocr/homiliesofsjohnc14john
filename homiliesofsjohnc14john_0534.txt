the patient waiting? That we should endure even as He
endurod, or that we should do those things, or that with

is disordcr. Tha! uullceth, he says, that is, liveth. And not
after the tradition which they receivedfmm me. Tradition,
ho says, which is through works. And this he always calls
properly ‘¹ tradition.
