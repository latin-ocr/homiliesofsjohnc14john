COLOSSIANS.
H Ο Μ Ι L Y Ι.

CoL. i. 1, ⁶2.

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by tlze will of God, and
Timotheus our brother, to tlze saints ancl faithful brethren
in Christ wlziclc are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and
peace, from Gocl our Fatlzer ancl tlze Lord Jesus Christ.

HOLY indeed are all the Epistles of Paul: but somewhat
more those which he sent after he was in bonds: those,
for instance, to the Ephesians and Philemon: that to Timothy,
that to the Philippians‚ and the one before us: for this also
was sent after he was a prisoner, since he writes in it thus:
sor which, Ι am also in bonds: tlzat I may make it manifest Col. 4,
as Ι oze-(flat to speak. But this Epistle appears to have been 3. 4.
written after that to the Romans. For the one to the
Romans he wrote before he had seen them, but this Epistle,
after3 and near upon the close of his p1·eaching³. And it is

⁸ Ed. Par. suspects that a sentence lemon as written in imprisonment, and
is lost here, but without reason, as he consequently later than that to the
hadjust mentioned the Epistle to Phi- Romans.
