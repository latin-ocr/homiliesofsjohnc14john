162 Terrors of Conscience. Peace with God and llIan.

Pau„ How much better this sort of life is! And tell me, which
-4ssi-32- is best, to envy, or to rejoice with another? Let us search
(3) out all these things, and we shall find that virtue, like a truly
kind mother, places us in safety, while vice throws us into
danger, being itself a treacherous thing, and full of danger.
P s. 25, For hear the prophet, who saith, The secret of tlze Lord is
Μ’ wille tlzem tlecctfectr H im, and He will sliew tlzem His covenant.
Hc feareth no one,who is notconscious to himselfofany wick-
edness3 on the contrary, he who liveth in crime is never con-
fident, but trembles at his slaves, and looks at them with

will be at peace with each other, God too will be with us, but
if we raise up war, the God of peace will not be with us. For
nothing is so hostile to the soul as vice, and nothing, on the
other hand, places it in sasety so much as peace and virtue.
WVheresore we must make a beginning from ourselves, and

then we shall draw God toward us. .
God is not a God os war and fighting, whercfore, make
war and contention to cease, both that which is against Him,
and that which is against thy neighbour. Be at peace with
Matt. 5, all men, consider whom God saveth. Blessed, saith he, are
‹ the peacemalcer3,f0r they shall be called the children qs
God. Such alway imitate the Son of God: do thou imitate
