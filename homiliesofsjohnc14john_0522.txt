account he 11115 1101 thus spoken, nor that it will be quickly,
although he is always saying it—-but what ? tlmc he mz'yht be

F ω· the myslery (gf iniqully (lolh already work·- He speaks
here of Nero, 115 ifhc were the typo of Antichrist. For he too
wished to be thought a god. And 118 has well said, the
myslery, for it worketh not openly, as the other, nor without
shamc. For if there was found a man ¹¹ before that time, he
means, who was not much behind Antichrist in wickedness,
what wonder, if there shall now be one ? Thus indeed he has
spoken covertly, and 118 did not wish to point him out plainly:
not from cowardice, but instructing us not to bring upon our-
selves unnecessary 81111111185, when there is nothing to call for
it. So indeed he 11150 says here. Only he who now letleth
will let, until he be taken out (gf the way, that is, when the
Roman empire 15 taken out of 1118 way, then he shall come.
And naturally. For as long as the sear of this empire lasts,
110 0118 will willingly be subject to him, but when that is
dissolved, 118 will attaek the anarehy, and endeavour to seize
upon the government both of men and of God. For as the
kingdoms before this were destroyed, that of the Medes by
the Babylonians, that of the Babyloni-ans by the Persians,
that of the Persians by the Macedonians, that of the Mace-
donians by the Romans: so will this be by Antichrist, and
he by Christ, and it will no longer withhold. And these
things Daniel delivers to 115 with great clearness.

And then, 118 says, shall that 11Τὶεῆρῶ be ret-ealerl. And
what aster this? The consolation is at hand. For he addS,

leom the Lorsl ἆρὰ-ηδ shall consume wilh the spirit (gf His
mouth, and shall (leslroy willa the bre'fjhtness (ff His come'ny.
Even him, ‘tc-hose coming] is (y'ler {he working) (ff Satan.

For as lire merely coming on even before 115 arrival makes
torpid and consumes the little animals that arc afar ofl'3 so
also Christ, by His commandmcnt only, and Coming, will
consume Antichrist. It 15 enough for Him to he present,
and all these things are destroyed. He will put a stop to
the deecit, by only appearing. Then shcwing who he is,
