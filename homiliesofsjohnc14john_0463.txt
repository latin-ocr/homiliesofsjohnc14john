He who sleeps sees not things that are and have a real
subsistence, but things that are not he fancies as things that

are. Such is vice, and the life that is passed in vice. It sees

not things that are, that is, heavenly, spiritual, abiding things,

but things that are fleeting and fly away, and that soon recede

from us.

But it is not sufficient to watch and be sober, we must
also be armed. For if a man watch and is sober, but has
not arms, the robbers soon dispatch him. When therefore
we ought to watch, and to be sober, and to be armed too,
and we are unarmed and naked and asleep, who will hinder
him from thrusting home his sword? WVherefore shewing
this also, that we have need of arms, he has added:

with right doctrines. See how he has shewn what it is to

darts of the devil can ever be fixed in it. For where the

the devices of those who plot against it are vain and ineffec-
tual. For neither wickedness‚ nor hatred, nor envy, nor
flattery, nor hypocrisy, nor any other thing will be able to
penetrate such a soul. And he has not simply said love, but
he has bid them put it on as 3 strong breastplate. Then
having said thus, he adds, andfor a helmet the hope of salva-
τίθη. For as the helmet guards the most important part of all
in us, surrounding the head and covering it 011 every side, so
also this hope does not suffer the reason to salter, but sets it eb· aa·
