yive thanks to God abactas for you all, makiny mention os
you in om· prayers. For to give thanks to God for them is
the act of one testifying to their great advancement, when
they are not only praised themselves, but God also is thanked
for them, as Himself having done it all. He teaches them
also to be moderate, all but saying, thatf 11 13 all of the power
of God. That he gives thanks for them, therefore, he declares
on account of their good conduct, but that he remembers
them in his prayers, proceeds from his love towards them.
Then shewing them that he not only remembers them 111 1113
1111111013, but apart from his prayers, 110 says, what he often
does, Rememberinq without cea-sing] your work offaitlc and

without ceasing? Either remembering before God and the

of God and the Fathcr. But 110 has not said merely, Re-

amongst men was praising their actions, no one giving them
any reward, he adds also this, all but saying‚ ‘ Be of good

are not the things promised such, that he who believes would

heaven is set before him, and immortality, and eterna] life.
He therefore who believes will suffer all things. Faith then
is shewn through 1113 works. J ustly therefore hath 110 spoken
