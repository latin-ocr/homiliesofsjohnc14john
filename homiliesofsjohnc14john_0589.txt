ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA.

Page 184, note i. προστῆναι is taken from a Note in Ed. Par. it should be
προ-στῆναι, which Mr. Field has pointed out to be the true reading in his notes
to the Homilies on St. Matthew, vol. iii. p. 145, note on p. 696 D. The sense
then is, ‘that what he has to say may not at once offend them)

Page 193, 2. Mr. Field would read, ὁὲν μὲν οὖν ἐξῆ χρήσασθαι, πάσης ἦδονῆς
μείζων ἧ αἰσχύνη, &e. ‘ If then it be allowed to use them, the shame is greater
than any pleasure.' A Paris ΜΞ. reads micam.

Page 206. (5.) l. 3. Mr. Field suggests, that the words ‘ who believe not that
there is a Judgment' are probably a marginal note that has crept into the text,
κατὰ ἀπιστούντων, Sec. being often so written. The first Edition has a full stop
at θάνατος.

Page 216. σπουδῆς may be fulness of meaning.
note h. A Paris Ms. has the same reading except line 7, where it is
‘ Creator’ instead of‘ Created!

Page 239. l. 1. Mr. F. suggests ἔξω εἷς for θείως, ‘see how he sheweth.' The
expression ‘ after a divine manner’ is certainly strong for the place.

Page 250. l. 2. Mr. F. conjectures, that orfimas. should be repeated, ‘ He hath
well said of saith. for &e.’ The reading of B. and 1 Par. gives the like sense,
⁴ He hath well said thus,' καλᾶἱς οὕτως.

Page 261. l. 22. Mr. F. suggests κατὰ τᾶν ’comaga-bv, ⁴ like dust,' which runs
better, the rest being abstraet terms.

Page 263. l. 2. from end. Mr. F. suggests the reading found in B. and likewise,
κωλύσειν for κολάσειν, ‘ forbid' for ‘punish’

Page 269. n. ὖπενθῦννι may be any persons amenable to the law.

Page 404, note i. Mr. F. suggests a translation of the common reading which
agrees well with the context. Taking it ‘ With reference to whom is this said θ’
just before, i. e. ‘ in comparison with whom ?' the parties spoken of are altered,
and the negative need not be introduced.

Page 442. l. 2, 3. from end. ‘proeured' might be rendered ‘gave.'

{lage 490, l. 1. perhaps rather ‘the hammerer (of silver) hammereth upon
no lug!
