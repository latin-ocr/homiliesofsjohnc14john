:324 Weepinysor others’ sins better than seez'ny Christ.

Coros-will (five my head water, and mine eyes sozmtains of tears?
4, Μ’ as though the natural fount wore not enough.

Nothing is swooter than these tears3 swcetcr are they than
any laughtor. They that mouru, know how great consola-
tion it possessoth. Lot us not think this a thing to be
deprocated, but one to bc even exceedingly prayed for3
not that others may sin, but that, when they sin, we may be
beart-broken sor them. Remember we these tears, these
bonds. Surcly too upon those bonds tears descended; but
[it was that g] the death of the perishing, of those that had
bound him in them, suffered him not to taste the pleasure of
the bonds. For, for their sake he grieved, being His disciple
that bewept the priests of the J ews3 not because they were
going to crucify Him, but because they were themselves
perishing. And He doeth not this Himself alone, but He

{ulmea thus exhorteth others also, saying, Dauqlzters QfJerusalem,

δ’ weep vot for Me. These eyes saw paradise, saw the third
heaven: but I count not them so blessed because of this
sight, as because of those tears, by the which they saw
Christ. Blessed‚ indeed, was that sight, for he himself even

'aman-glories in it¹‚ saying, Have I not seen Jesus Clu-ist our

{³60,.‚ Lord ? but more blessed so to weep.

are they that have not seen, and yet haee believed; but unto
Phil. 1, this not many have attained. For if to stay here for Christ's
23·24· sake were more needful than to depart to Him, on account
of the salvation of others; surely then to groan for others’
sakes‚ is more needful even than to see Him. For if for
His sake to be in hell ¹², is rather to be desired, than to be
with Him 3 and to be separated from Him for His sake more
to be desired than to be with Him, (for this is what he said,
Rom. 9, For J could wislc that myself were accursed from Christ)
{ets 20, much more is weeping sor His sake. I ceased not, he saith,
31· to wara every one with (ears. VVherefore? Not fearing the
dangers3 no3 but as if one sitting by a sick man's side, and
not knowing what would be the end, should weep for affec-
