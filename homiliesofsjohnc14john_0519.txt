kings read here. Then if any 0110 coines from a king, yon Hom.
all attend; and does a Prophet 001110 from God, and spe-ak III.
from heaven, and no one attend? Or do you not believe

that these things are nwssages from God? These are letters

sent from G0d3 therefore let us enter with beeoming
reverence into the ChurcheS, and let ns hearken with sear to

the things here said.

What do I come 111 for‚you say, if I do not hear some 0110
discoursing? This is the ruin and destruction os all. For
what need of a person to discourse? This necessity arises
from our sloth. Wherefore any necessity for a homily ? All
things are clear and open that are in the divine Scriptures3
all things that are necessary are plain. ssut because ye are

 

hearers for pleasure's sake, for that reason also you seek these
things. For tell 1110, with what pomp of words (lid Paul
speak? and yet he converted the world. Or with what the
unlettered Peter? But I know 1101, you say, the things that
are contained in the divine Scriptures. Why (10 you not
know them ? For are they spoken 111 Hebrew? Are they in
Latin, or in foreign tongues? Are they not in Greek? ssut
they are expressed obscurely, you say. What is it that is
obscure? Are there not histories? For (of course) you
know the plain parts, in that you enquire about the obscure.
There are numberless histories in the Scriptures. Tell me
one of these. But you cannot. These things are an excuse,
and mere words. Every day, you say, one hears the same
things. Tell 1110, 111011, (10 you 1101 hear the same things in
the theatres? Do you not see the same things in the race-
course? Are not all things the same? Is it not always the
same sun that rises ? Is it not the same food that we use?
I should like to ask you, since you say that you every day
hear the same things3 tell me, from what Prophet was the
passage that was read? from what Apossse, or what Epistle?
But you cannot tell me——you seem to hear strange things.
When therefore youwish to be 3101111111, you say that they are
1110 same things. But when you arc questioned, you are in
the case osone who never heard them. If they are the
3111110, you ought to know them. But you are ignorantes

theni.
