have no hope. Therefore to afflict yourselves for the
departed is to act like those who have no hope. And they
justly. For a soul that knows nothing of the Resurrection,

but thinks that this death is death, naturally afflicts itself, and
bewails and monrns intolerably as for those who are lost.

But thou, who expectest a resurrection, on what account

dost thou lament? To lament then is the part of those who

have no hope.

as many as at times of mourning take the sorrow impatiently,

that ye act the part of heathens. But if to grieve for the
departed is the part of heathens, then tell me whose part it is

to beat one's self, and tear the cheeks? On what account do

you lament, if you believe that he will rise again, that he has

but being left destitute of support, and having lost my pro-
tector, my comp-anion, who shared with me in all things—

my comforter. On this account I mourn. I know that he

will rise again, but I cannot bear the intermediate separation.
