190 Present pleasure least in splendidfeast.s·.

And even in this respect, then, there is more of this plea-
sure, namcly, that it is more pleasure to sit down with
a King than with his servants. But let us withdraw this con-
sideration 0180, letus examine the matter simply by itself;
I, then, and those who 0110080 1110 table Ι (10, 811011 with
much freedom and ease of mind say and hear every thing:
but you trembling and fearing, and ashamed before those you
sit down with, will not even have the heart to reach out your
hands,just as though you had got to a school, and not a
dinner, just as though you were trembling before masters
whom you dreaded. But not so they. But, saith 0110, 1110
honour is great. Nay, I further am in more honour, for your
mean estate¹ shews the more strikingly: when even whilst
sharing the same table, the words ye utter are those of slaves.

For the servant then most of 011 shews as such, when he
sits down with 1118 master, for he is in a place where he
ought not to be3 nor hath he from such familiarity so much
dignity as he hath 0110801110111, for he is then abased exceed-
ingly. And 0110 may see a servant by himself make 0 brave
appearance, the poor man seem splendid by himself 3 not
however when he 18 walking with 0 rich 0110, for the low when
near the lofty, then appears lOW, and the juxtaposition makes
the low seem lower, not loftier. So too your sitting down
with them makes you seem as of yet meaner condition. But
not so, us. In these two things, then, we have the advantage,
in freedom, and in honour3 which have nothing equal to
them in regard of pleasure. For I at least would prefer a
crust with freedom, to thousands of dainties with slavery.
For, saith one, Better is an entertainment ofleerbs with love
and lcindness, than cm oxfivm tlte stall with balred. For
whatsoever those2 may say, they who are present must necds
praise it, or give offence3 assuming thus the rank of 1101081108,
or rather, being worse than they. For parasites indeed, even
though it be with shame and insult, have yet liberty of speech:
but ye have not even this. But your meanness is indeed as
great, (sor ye fear and croueh,) but not so your honour.
Surely then that table is deprived of every pleasure, but this
is replete with all delight os soul.

But let us examine the nature even of the meats them-
selves. For there indeed it is necessary to burst one's sels
