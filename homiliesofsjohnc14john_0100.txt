2¹ 1μᾷ our stand with Him who 18 our King, he draws himself in,
and will bc no better than a little child in his warsare against
us. thensoever we stand apart from Him, he pulseth him-
self up greatly, he uttereth terrible sounds, he grindeth 1118
teeth, because he finds us without our greatest help. For he
will not approach to us, except God permit him; for if he
‹lared not to enter into the herd of swine, except by God’s
permission> how much less into men’s souls. But God does
permit him, either to chasten, or to punish us, 01· to make ns
more approved, as in the case of Job. Seest thou that 116
carne not to him, neither dared 1ο 116 near him, but trembled
and quaked? Why speak Ι of Job? then 116 leaped upon
Judas, he dared notp to seize 011 him wholly, and to enter
into him, until that Christ had severed him from the sacred
band. He attacked him indeed from without, but he dared not
enter in, 11111 when 116 saw him cut off from that holy flock,

So drunken was he with this love, that he betrayed the Lord
of the world for thirty pieces of silver. What can be worse
than this madness? Him to whom nothing is equivalent,

15. Him did he betray sor thirty pieces os silver. A grievous
tyrant indeed is the love of gold, and terrible in putting the
soul beside itself. A man is not so beside himself through
111-1111116111168811 as through love of gold, 1101 80 much from mad-
ness and insanity as from love of gold.

For tell me, why didst thou betray Him? He called thee,
when a man unmarked and unknown. He made thee one of
the twelve, He gave thee a share 111 1118 teaching, He pro-
mised thee ten thousand good things, lle caused thee to work
