number of children that we are thus mad, but from the love ΗξΞΜ·
of money. And who are they, you say, who having children, Δ ”
yet despise riches? Many, and in many places. And if you
will allow me, I will speak also of instanees among tho
ancients.

Had not Jacob twelve children ? Did he not lead the life
osa hireling? lVas he not wronged by his kinsman? and
did 116 1101 osten disappoint him? And did his number of
children ever compel him to have recourse to any dishonest
counsel? What was the ease with Abraham. After Isaac, had
116 1101 6150 many other children? Did he not possess all he
had for the benefit of strangers? Do you see, how he not
only did not do wrong, 11111 even gave up his possessions, not
only doing good, but choosing to be wronged by his nephew?
For to endure being robbed for the sake of God is a much
greater thing than to do good. For the one is the fruit of
the soul andos sree ehoiee, whence also it is easily performed:
but 1116 011161· 15 injurious treatment and violence. For a man
will more easily throw away 1611 thousand talents vohmtarily,
and will not think that he has suffered any harm, than he
will bear meekly being robbed of three pence against his will.
So that this rather is philosophy of soul. And this,
we see, happened in the case of Abraham. For Lot, it is said, From
belzelcl all the plain ; and z't was well uatered as· the paradise &nilla
of God, and 116 chose «it. And Abraham said nothing against
it. Seest thou, that he not only did not wrong him, but he
was wronged by him ? Why, O man, dost thou accuse thine
own children? God did not give us children for this end,
that we should seize the possessions of others. Take care,
lest in saying this thou provoke God. For if thou saycst
that thy children are the causes of thy grasping and thine
avarice, I sear lest thou be deprived of them, as injuring and
ensnaring thee. God hath given thee children that they
may support thine old age, that they may learn virtue from
thee.

For God on 11115 account hath willed that mankind should (4)
111115 116 held together, providiug for two most important
objects: one, the appointing fathers to be teaehers, and the
other, the implanting great love. F or if 111611 were merely to
come into being, no one would have any relation¹ towa1·cl;¹crx²c1v·
