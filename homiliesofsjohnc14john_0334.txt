304 Christ the Clotlaz'uq of those who are His.

Wouldest thou appear fair and comely? Be content with
the Creator's sashioning. thy dost thou 016113)ν 111656 bits
of gold, as if about to put to rights God's creation ? Wouldest
thou appear comely? Clothe thee iu alms; clotho thee in
benevolence3 clothe thee in modesty‚ humbleness. These
are all more preeious than gold; these make the beautiful
even yet more comely3 these make even the ill formed to be
well formed. For when any one looks upon a countenauce
with good will, he gives his judgment from love; but an
evil woman, even though she be beautiful, 110116 can call
beautiful; for the mind being wounded pronounceth 1101115
sentence aright.

That Egyptian woman of old was adorned3 Joseph too
was adorned; which of them was the more beautiful? Ι say
not when 5116 was in the palace, and he in the prisonss. He
was naked‚ but clothed iu the garments of chastity3 she was
clothed‚ but more unseemly than if she had been naked 3 for
she had not modesty. When thou hast excessively adorned
thee, O woman, then thou art become more unseemly than a
naked one3 for thou hast stripped thee of thy fair adorning.
Eve also was naked; but when she had clothed herself, then
was she more unseemly, for when she was naked indeed, she
was adorned with the glory of God3 but when she had
clothed herself with the garment of sin, then was she un-
seemly. And thou, when arrayed 111 1116 garment of studied

ι· finery¹‚ dost then appear more unseemly: for that costliness
⁶ availeth not to make any appear beautiful. But that it is pos-

sible even for one dressed 0111 10 be even more unseemly
than if naked, I will tell you. If thou hadst ever put on the
dresses of a piper 01· 3 ssute—player‚ would it not have been
unseemliness? And yet those dresses are of gold; but for
this very reason it were 11115661111111655, because they are of
gold. For 1116 eostliness of the stage suits well with trage-
dians, players, mimos, dancers, fighters with wild beasts 3 but
10 3 woman that is a believer, there have been given other
robes from God, the Only-Begotten Son of God Himself.
For, he saith, as many as leuce been baptized into Christ,
leave put οη Christ. Tell me, if 0116 had given thee kingly

g Downes would remove the negative, &e. but even when he was exposed by
'but the meaning is ‘ not only when the loss os his garment!
