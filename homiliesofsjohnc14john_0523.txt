Why then, you say, did God permit this to be? and
what dispensation is this? And what is the advantage of
his coming, who comes to our 1’11111”.Ρ Fear not, beloved, but
hear Him saying, In [leem that pere'sla he hath strength,
who, even if he had not come, would not have believed.
What then is the advantage? you say. That these very men
who perish will be put to silence. How? Because even if
he had not come, they would not have believed in Christ.
He comes therefore to convict them. For that they may
not have occasion to say, that since Christ said that He was
God,—-although He no where said this openly,·—but since
those who came after proclaimed it, we have not believed.
Because we have heard that there is One God from WVhom are
all things, therefore we have not believed. This their pretext
then Antichrist will take away. For when he comes, and
comes commanding nothing good, but all things unlawful, and
is yet believed from false signs alone, he will stop¹ th eir mouths. mugga}-

not to believe in Antichrist. For the former said that He
was sent from the Father‚ but the latter the contrary. For
this reason Christ said, I am come in My Fatlzer's name, and John 5,

kim ye will receive. But we have seen signs, you say. But
many and great signs were wrought by Christ. Much more
therefore ought ye to have believed in Him. And yet many
things were predicted concerning this one, that he is that
wicked‚ that he is the son of perdition, that his coming is

after the working of Satan. But the contrary concerning
Him, that He is the Saviour, that He brings with Him
unnumbered blessings.
