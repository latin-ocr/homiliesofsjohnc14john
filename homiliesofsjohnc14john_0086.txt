not the same thing to shine when known, and contrary to
expectation, so that its being unlooked for rendered him the
more admirable 3) what then did he say, when he came
before Pharaoh? W'as it, ‘ Yea,I know the dream ?' Not
so, but what? W⁷hen no one urged it on him, he said from
his own excellent spirit, Do not interpretations belowq to
God²s² Behold he straightway glorified his Master, where-

to glory. For that God had revealed it to him was a far
greater thing· than if he had excelled himself . Moreover, he

enchanters, yea when the whole of their wisdom was not only
coming to be convicted, but to be wholly destroyed, <for their
being destroyed was a clear proof that they had deceived be-

king's question, does not take the honour to himself, but first
ascribes the whole to God, and says, But assor me, O king),
