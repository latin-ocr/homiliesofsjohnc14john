Τ ke rich poor within, the poor rich, willein. 193

and art thou not ashamed to call this pleasure? If now it be HOM-
allowed to have the full pleasure of them, the greater is the I'
shame, and the discomfort which arises from the shame.

And how? Is it not a grievous thing to make one's house a
brothel, and to take delight like hogs in wallowing in the mire ?

But if so far only be allowed as to see them, lo! again the

pain is greater. For to see is no pleasure‚ where to use is

not allowed, but the lust becomes only the greater, and the
flame the fiercer.

But wouldest thou learn the end? Those, indeed, when
they rise up stom the table, are like the madmen and those
that have lost their wits, foolhardy, quarrelsome, laughing-
stocks for the very slaves3 and the servants indeed return
home sober, but these, drunk. O the shame! But with the
other is nothing of this sort3 but closing the table with
thanksgiving, they so return to their homes, with pleasure
sleeping, with pleasure waking, free from all shame and

 

accusation.

If thou wilt consider also the guests themselves, thou wilt (6.)
see that the one are within, what the other are without3

gratification a maiming takes place 3 of such sort is surfeiting
and drunkenness, making men lame and maimed, And thou
wilt see too that these have souls like the bodies of the others,
bright, ornamented. For they who live in giving of thanks,
who seek nothing beyond a sufficiency, they whose philo-
sophy is of this sort are in all brightness.

But let us see the end both here and there. There, indeed,
is unchaste pleasure, loose laughter, drunkenness, buffoonery ¹, 1 ⁵¹³⁷&-
filthy language3 (for since they in their own persons are πξλὲαιὴ
ashamed to talk filthily, this is brought about by means of the 2541) ’
harlots3) but here is love of mankind, gentleness. Near to him

the other, love of man, and gentleness. For the one table, love 30⁹⁷?ss
