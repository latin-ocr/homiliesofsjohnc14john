HOMILY ΙΙ.

COL. i. 9, 10.

For this &cluse we also, since tlze clay we heard it, clo not
cea-ee to pray for you, and io desire that ye miylzt be
filled witlz tlte lmowledqe of His will in all wz'sclom and
spiritual understandiny ; T leat ye 72²2th ualle u-ortlzy of
the Lord emto all pleasiozy, beiny fivcz’g‘ful in every qood
work, and inc-reasinq in tlte lcozowledye of God.

For this cause. What cause ? Because we heard of your
saith and love, because we have good hopes, we are hopeful
to ask for future blessings also. For as in the games we
eheer on those most who are near upon gaining the victory, so
truly doth Paul also most exhort those who have achieved
the greater part.

Since the day we heard z't, saith he, πθ clo ποί cease to
pray for you. Not for one day do we pray sor yon, nor
yet for two, nor three. Herein he both shews his love, and
gives them a gentle hint that they had not yet arrived at the
end. For the words, that με mz'ylzt be filled, are of this
significancy. And observe‚ I pray, the prudence of this
blessed one. He no where says that they had been cut off
from cmnpletenessss but, every where that they fell short3
for the words, that sese miylet befilled, shew this. And again,
unio all pleasiny, in every qood work, and again, strenytlc- ver. 11.
ened with all mmm, and again, mtto alc patience ancl long]-
szqfferinq; sor the word all is that of one bearing witness
to their well doing in part, though, it might be, not in all.
And, that pse miqlat be filled, he saith3 not, ‘ that ye might
receive‚' for they had received3 but that ye mz'ylet befilled

² τοῦ πάν-τος ἀπιστιρῗισθαι. It seems to mean this, rather than ⁶ had lost a11.’
