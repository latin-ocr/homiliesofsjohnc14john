said not only to them, but also to you. For that the promise
is not made to them only, but to those also who walk in their
steps, is manifest from His saying to tlze end os tlze world.

What then does He say to those who are not teaeliers?1xlox‹AL.
Each of you, if 116 will, is a teacher, although not of another,
yet of himself, Teach thyself first. If thou teachest¹ t0¹i.e.thy-

thou wilt have many enullating thee. For as a lamp, when
it is shining, is able to lighth ten thousand, but being extin-
guished will not give light even to itself, nor canit lighten
other lamps3 so also in the case of a pure life, if the light
that is in us be shining, we shall make both disciples and
teaohers numberless, being set before them as a pattern to
copy. For neither will the words proeeeding from me be

wife, (for it is possible for a man having a wife and chil-

much more than I to benefit all? For me they will heari

they have kept what they have heard as far as the threshold

but seeing the life of that man constantly, they receive great
advantage. For when being insulted he insults not again,
does he not almost infix and engrave upon the soul of the
insulter the reverence of his meekness? And though he does
not immediately confess the benefit, being ashamed from
anger, or put to confusion, yet nevertheless he immediately
is made sensible of it. And it is impossible for a man that
is insolent, though he be a very beast, to associate with one
who is patient of evil, without going away much benefited.
For although we do not what is good, we however all praise
it and admire it. Again, the wife, if she see her husband
meek, being always with him, receives great advantage, and
the child also. It is therefore in the power of every one to
