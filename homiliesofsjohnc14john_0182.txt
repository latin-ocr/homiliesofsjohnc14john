152 Women recommmled to care. Benefit of this.

Ver. 2, 3. Ι besem-k Ezcoclms, and beseeclz Syntyelze, that
they be ostke same mind in tlte Lord. And I entreac thee
also, true yolcejfellow, help those vwomen.

Some say Paul here entreats his own wise3 but it is 1101

1118111. Help those women, which laboured willa us in tlte
Gospel, ovim C'lcmlenl also, and with other mysellowlabomvrs,
whose names are in the book- qflt'j'e. Scest thou how great a
testimony he beareth 10 their virtue? For as Christ saith to His
Apostles, Rejoz'ce «not that the spirits (tre subject to you, but
anilem· rejoice, because yom· names are written in the book os
lejfffi 50 Paul testifieth to them, saying, whose names are
in tlte book os lg'fe. These women seem to me to be the
chief of the Church which was there, and he commendeth
1110111 10 501118 notable man whom he calls his yokesellozo, to
whom perehanoe he was wont to commend them, as to an
assistant, and sellow-soldier, and brother, and companion, as
he doth in the Epistle to the Romans, when he saith, I com-
mend unio you Plaebe om· sister, which is a serrant qs the
Clmrclc which is at Cena-laren. Yokqfellow. It is either
some brother of theirs, or the husband of some one of them,
he calls so: as if 118 had said, Now thou art a true brother,
now a true husband, because thou hast become a Member.
W'ltz‘clc laboured with me in the Gospel. This protectiond
was not from friendship, but for good deedS. Labouriuy
mille me. What sayest thou? Did women labourl with thee?
Y es, he answereth, they too eontributed no small portion.
Although many were they who wrought together with him,
yet these women wrought amongst the many. The Churohes
then were no little edified, sor many good ends are there
gained where they who are approved, be they men, 01· be they
women, enjoy from the rest such honour. For in the first
place the rest are led on to a like zea13 in the second place,
they also gainede by the respect shewn3 and thirdly, they made
those very persons more zealous and earnest. VVherefore
thou 50851 that Paul hath every where a care for this, and
commendeti] 511811 men for consideration. As he saith in the
Epistle 10 the Corinthians: Wlm are llee Jae'rstssfruils qs
