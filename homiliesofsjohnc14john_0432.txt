402 God recalls His yg'fts when preferred to Himsegfi

1Tmzs.Who gave thee thy very husband? was it not IIe? And

4' 9. ¹⁰⁹ who made thee? &Vas it not He? He surely Who brought
thee out of nothing into being, and breathed into thee a soul‚
and bestowed on thee a mind, and vouchsafed to favour thee
with the knowledge of IIimself, and sor thy sake spared not
llis only—begotten Son, does not He spare thee? And will
a fellow-servant spare thee? that wrath is due to these
words ! What os this kind hast thou had from thy husband?
Thou canst not say any thing. For is even he has done
thee any kindness, it was after he had received kindness,
you having previously begun. But in the case of God no
one can say any such thing. For it is not as having received
any favours from us that God benefits us, but being incapa-

thanks, to cast thyself wholly upon Him? For what is it
that thou hast received from thy husband? The pains of
childbirth, and labours, and insults and reproaches, perchance,
and chidings, and bursts of anger. Are not these the things
that come srom husbands? But there are, you say, other
good things too. Of what sort then are these? Did he set
off thy beauty with eostly garments? Did he put gold orna-
ments about thy sace? Did he make thee respected by all?
But if thou wilt, God will adorn thee with a much better

’σεμνότης ornament than tho departed. For gravity¹ makes its pos-
sessor much more admirable than golden ornaments. This
King also has garments, not of this sort, but much better.
With those, if thou wilt, invest thyself. Of what sort then
are they? Thero is a clothing which has fringes of gold,
with this, if thou wilt, array the soul. But did he make
thee not to he despised hymen? And what is there great
