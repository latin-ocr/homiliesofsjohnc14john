Ι could wish to discourse of the pleasures of being with
Christ, though they pass all expression and all understand-
ing. Yet would Ι speak of these things according to my
power. But what shall I do? it is not possible to speak
concerning a kingdom ¹¹ to one that is diseased and in fever;
then we must needs speak of health. It is not possible to
speak of honour to one that is brought to trial, sor at that
time his desire is that he be freed from judgment, and penalty,
and punishment. If this be not effected, how shall the other
be? It is for this cause that Ι am continually speaking· of
these things, that we may the sooner pass over to those
other. For this cause does God threaten hell, that none may
fall into hell, that we all may obtain the kingdom3 for this
cause we too make mention eontinually of hell, that we may
thrust you onward towards the kingdom, that when we have
sostened your minds by fear, we may bring you to act
worthily of the kingdom. Be not then displeased at the
heaviness of our words, sor the heaviness of these words
lightens our souls from sin ἢ. Ι1·011 is beavy, and the hammer
