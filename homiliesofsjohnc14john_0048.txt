For God is my record, how ⁴qreatly I louq aster you all in tlze

HE calls not God to witness as though he should be doubted,
but does this from his great affection, and his exceeding persua-
sion and confidenoe3 for after saying that they communicated
with him, he adds this also, in the ὃσα-οἰδ of Christ, lest they
should think that his longing for them was sor this cause, and
not simply sor their own sake. And what mean these words?
They stand for ‘⁶ according to Cluistff’ Because ye are
believers, because ye love Him, because of his love to-

warnier expression, the howels os Christ, as though he had
said², “ of him who has become as a father to you through
the relationship which is in Christ.” For this imparts
to us bowels of affection warin and glowing. For He
gives such bowels to His true servants. ‘⁶ In these bowels‚''
saith He, ‘⁶ I love you‚'' as though one should say, ‘⁶ with no
natural bowels, but with more ardent ones, namely, those of
Christ.⁷' How yreatly I [0129 (gfleryouall, Ι long astc1·all,since

long aster you, for I ain unable in words to represent to you
my longing, whereforo I leave it to God, Whose range is in
tho heart, to know this. Now had he been flattering them, he
would not have called God to witness, sor this cannot be done
without peril.
