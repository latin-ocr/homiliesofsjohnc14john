consider, I pray: the whole world left those who were at *³22*

imprisoners, it honoureth those laden with chains; hating

the crucifiers, it worships the Crucified.

Not the only marvel is it that the preachers were fishermeu, &4 )
that they were ignorant; but that there were other hindranceS,
hindranees too by nature3 still the increase was all the more
abundant. Not only was their ignorance no hindrance3 but
even it itself caused the Proclamation to be manifested. For
hear Luke saying, And perceivinq that they were mzleczrnecl Acts 4,
and iynorant men, tlzey marvelled. Not only were bondsl3·

tion was not hindered. For, canst thou put the tongue in
bonds? for hereby chiefly it runneth. For as, except thou
