St. Paul rejoiced without approvinq. -23

Christ is preaclaed. He did not lay down the law and say, Hom.
“ Let Him be preached,'' but first he was reporting the event ; ΙΙ·
secondly, had he even spoken as laying down the law, not
even thus did he give entrance to heresy.

Let us examine, if you please, the matter, and we shall (3)
discover that, even if he gave pcrmission to prcach as they
preached, no entrance was given to heresy. How so ? In that
they preached healthfully, though the aim and purpose on
which they acted was corrupted, still the preaching was not
changed, and they were forced so to preach. And why? Be-
cause, had they preached otherwise than as Paul preached,
had they taught otherwise than as he taught, they would not
have increased the anger of the Emperor. But now by fur-
thering his preaching, by teaching in the same way, and
making disciples as he did, they had power to exasperate the
Emperor, when he saw the multitude of the disciples nume-
rous. But then some wicked and senseless man, taking hold
of this text, says, Verily they would have done the contrary,
they who have driven off those who had already believed, in-
stead of making believers to abound, had they wished to annoy
him. What shall we answer? That they looked to this
thing only, how they might involve himin present danger,
and leave him no escape3 and thus they thought to grieve
him, and to quench the Gospel, rather than in the other way.

By that other course they would have extinguished the
wrath of the Emperor, they would have let him go at large
and preach again, hut by this course they thought that be-
cause of him all were ruined, could they but destroy him.
The many however could not understand this, but certain
bitter and deeply wicked men alone.

Then‚ in this, says he, I clo regy‘oz'ee, θρα, ancl will rey'oice.
What means, yea, I will rey'oz'ce ,9 Even if this be done still
more, he means. For they work with me even against their
will; and will receive punishment for their toil, whilst I,
who have nought contributed theretO, shall receive reward.
Is there any thing beyond this villainy of the Devil, to devise
the undertaking of a preaching that entails punishment on
those who adopt it? Seest thou with how many evils he
pierces through his own! He contrives punishment and
vengeance for them from the preachin g, and from these labours.
