86 Conceit and pride worse than mealmess os mind.

humbled by others. Haughtiness is a great evil, it is better
to be a fool than haughty3 for in the one case, the folly is
only a perversiori os intellect, but in the other case it is still
worse3 sor it is folly joined with madness: the sool is an
evil to himself3 but the haughty man is a plague to others
too. This misery comes of senselessness. One cannot be
haughty-minded without being a fool; and he that is brim-
full of folly is haughty ¹.

Listen to 1116 Wise Mau, who says, See-st thou a man wise
in leis own conceit? there is more hope ofasool than- ofleim.
Secst thou how it was not without reason I said, that the evil
of which I am speaking is worse than that of folly, for it is
written, There is more hope of a fool {Izan of him? Where-

man must nceds be insolent‚ a brawlcr, wrathful, bitter‚
sullen, a beast rather than a man. Art thou strong, and
proud thereat? Thou shoulclest rather he humble on this
account. thy art thou proucl sor a thing of nought? For
a lion is bolcler than thou, a wild boar is stronger, and thou
art not even as a fly 111 comparison with them. Robbers too,
and violaters of tombs, and gladiators, and even thine own
slaves, and those perchance who arc the worst subjects, are
strongor than thou. 15 11115 then a fit subject for praise?
Art thou proud of such a matter? Bury thyself for shame!

But art thou handsome and beautiful? This is the boast
of crows! Thou art not sairer than the peacock, as regards
either its colour or its plumage3 the bird bcats thee in piumage,
