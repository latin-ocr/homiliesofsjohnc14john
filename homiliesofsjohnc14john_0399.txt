Sickness· and worldly loss opportunitz'es (gf-qaia. :369

him. Hast thou fallen into a severe sickness, and do many
come, constraining thee, some with charms, some with
amulets, and 0111615 with other things, to remedy the evil?
and hast thou borne it firmly and unflinchingly from the sear
of God, and chosen to suffer 311 things rather than submit to
do any of those idolatrous practices ? This brings to thee the
erown of martyrdom. Doubt it not. Howt and by what
means? I will 1611 11166. For as such an one bears firmly
the pains of torture, so as not to worship the image, even
so thou bearest the sufferings of thy disease, so as to want
nothing of those remedies which the other offers, nor to do
the things which he prescribes, ⁶ But those pains are more
violent'—-yes, but these are of longer duration, so that it is the
same in the end3 nay often these are more severe too. For
tell me, when sever is raging and burning within, and thou
rejectest the 61131111 11131 0111615 recommendto thee, hast thou
not bound on thee the crown of martyrdom?

Again, has any one lost money? many advise thee to have
recourse to diviners 3 but thou, from sear of God, because it
is forbidden, choosest rather not to receive thy money than
to disobey God—thou hast a reward equal to him who has
given it to the poor. If having lost, thou givest thanks, and
when able to have 16603156 to diviners, thou bearest not to
receive, rather than 50 10 receive it, thou art equal in respect
of gain to him, who has divested himself of the same sor
God's sake. For as he from the sear of God has given all
1ο 1116 poor, so thou also from fear of God, when they have
plundered thee, hast not recovered it.

We are the masters of injuring or not injuring ourselves.
And if you will, let 35 make the whole matter plain in the
6356 of theft itself. The thies has broken through the wall,
he has rushed into the chamber, he has carried off costly
golden vessels, and precious stones, in short, he has cleared
thy whole 11635316, and has not been taken. The fact is
grievous, and it seems to be a loss3 still 35 yet it is not
so, but it depends on thee to make it either a 1055 or a
gain. Ansl how, sayest thou, can this be a gain? I will

t l Ms. But if thou livest, how.
