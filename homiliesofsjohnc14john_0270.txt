240Acc W'isdom iu Christ ,St .Paul present inspiret {Itouyltfaroffl

Coros, of God‚ the being brought unto ssim by the Son. And os
2’ 4· δ’ Christ, in leom are leid all tlte treasures Ql' wz'sdom and
knowledye. But if they are in Him, then wisely also no
doubt He 031110 31 this time. Wherefore then do some soolish
persons object to Him, ⁶ See how He discourseth with the sim-
¹ Αὐτόε pler so1·t.' In W‘lzom are all tlze treasures, He 310110Ι knows
all things. Hicl, for think notin truth that ye already have all 3
they are hidden also even from Angels, not from you only3
2A1’m25 so that you ought to ask all things from Him. He a1011e‘2
giveth wisdom and knowledge. Now by saying, treasures,
he shews their largeness, by All, that He is ignorant of
nothing, by lzz'd, that He alone knoweth.
Ver. 4. And tlzz‘s I say, lest any man should beyuz‘le you
³ or per· willa euticinyss words.
εἰῖεέῗ Seest thou that he saith, Ι have therefore said this, that
ye may not seek it from men. Beyuile you, he saith, wille

absent in the flesh‚ yet, nevertheless, I know the deceivers ;’ but
instead he has ended with praise, Joyz'ny (md belzolclz'ny your
order, amc tlze steclfastozess of your saith iu Christ. Your
5 meg„ order, he means, your good order. And tlte sleclsasmess of your

And he said not ‘ faith,' but stedsastness‚ as to soldiers standing
«5 mffi„ in good order and firmly. Now that which 15 510(113516, neither
{Ogjssa- deceit nor trial can shake asunder7. Not only, he saith,
λεύει have ye not fallen, but no one 113111 so much as thrown you
into disorder. Hc hath set himself over them, that they may
sear him as though prescnt3 for thus is order preserved.
From solidity follows eompactedness, for you will then pro-
duce solidity, when having brought many things together,
you shall cernent them compacte-(Hy and inseparably 3 then a
solidity is produced, as in the case of a wall. But this is the
