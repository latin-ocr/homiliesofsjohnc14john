Om· Lord wherein like, wherezssn amm-e lo men. 79

Again, what shall we say to contradict Paul of Samosata? Hom.
what did he affirm? The very same. But it is no emptying of VII.
Himself, that 0110 of human nature, and a mere man, should
wash his follow-servants. For what we said against the
Arians, we must repeat against these too, for they differ not
from one another, save by a little space of time3 both the
one and the other affirm the Son of God to be a creature.
What then shall we say to them? If He being a inan washed
man, He emptied not, He humbled not Himself. If He
being a man seized not on being equal with God, He is not
desem-ing of praise. That God should become man, is great,
unspeakable, inexpressible humility3 but what humility is
there in that one, who was a man, should do the works of men ?

And where is the work of God ever called the form (gf Gocl ?
for if He were a mere man, and was called the sorm of God
by reason of His works, why do we not say tho same of
Peter, 101· 110 wrought greater deeds than Chn'st Himself?
Why say you not of Paul, that he had the form of God,>
Why did not Paul give an example of himself, 101· 110
wrought very many servile works, and refused none. He
says, For we preacla not our-solves, bul olm-ist jesus tlte Lord, 2 Cor.
and our-selues your serranz-sfor Jesus' salse. 4, 5.

These are absurdities and trifles! Scripture says, He emptiecl
Himseff. How did He empty Himself? tell me. that was
His emptying? what His humiliation? was it because He
wrought wonders? But this Paul and Peter did, so that this
was not peculial· to the Son. What means this which he
sayS, Βρίγες] made in the likeness of men? He had many
things belonging to us, and many He had not 3 for instance,
He was not born of wedlock. He did no sin. These things
had He which no man has. He was not what He seemed
only, but He was God also3 He seemed to be a man, but He
was not like the mass of men, though He were like them in
flesh. He means then, that He was not a mere man. VVhere-
fore he says, in tlte likeness of men. For we indeed are soul
and body, but He was God, and soul and body, Wherefore
he says, in the lili-eneas. For lest when you hear that He
emptied Himsels, you should think that some change, and

poreal being, He was not seen, He was first ‘ not‚' and has ‘ and was not,' but
not in a body.' Bon. Lat. omits the without Greek authority.
