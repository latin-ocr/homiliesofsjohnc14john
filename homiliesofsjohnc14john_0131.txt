HOMILY IX.

PHIL. ii. 19, 20, 21.

But I trust in the Lord Jesus to sencl Timotheus shortly unto
you, that I also may be of yoocl comfort, when Ι know
your state. For I have no man likeminded, uho will
naturally care sor your state. For all seeh their own, not
the thinys which are Jesus Christ's.

HE had said, that the lhinys which have happened unto Phil. 1,
me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel; ¹2⁸ ¹3·
so that my bonds m Ohrzst are mangfesc en all the palace.
Again, Yea ancl f I be offered upon the sacrzfice and service Phil· 2,
(ffv your saith, Ι yoy, ancl r'eyozce wzth you all. By these l¹'
words he strengthened them. Perchance they might suspect
that his former words were spoken just to comfort them.
What then does he? how does he free them from this sus-
picion? By saying, I will send Timothy shortly unto you,
for they desired to hear all things that concerned him. And
wherefore said he not, “ that ye may know my state,'' but,

“ that I may know yours ?'⁷ Because Epaphroditus would

have reported his state before the arlival ofTimothy. Where-

fore further on he says, Jet I supposed it necessary to sencl Phi-l 2,
to you EpaphrodituS, my brother. But he means, I wish to 25
leam of your affairs, for it was likely that he had remained long

time with Paul through his bodily weakness. So that it is
suitably he sayS, Ι wish to know your state. See how he
refers every thing to Christ, even the mission of Timothy,
