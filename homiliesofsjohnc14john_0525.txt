How hath He chosen you to salvation? he shews by say· ’ ’
ing, [n sanctificate'on ofthe Spirit, that is, to sanctify by the
Spirit and a true saith. To sanctify you by the Spirit. For
these are the things that are the efficient causest of our
salvation. It is no where of works, no where of righteous
deeds, but through belief of the truth. Here again, 22'72 is23’

This too is no little thing, if Christ considers our salvation
His glory. For it is the glory of the Friend of man that
they that are saved should be many. Great then is our
Lord, if He so desires our salvation. Great also is the Holy

say saith first, but sanctification? Because even after
sanctification we have yet need of much saith, that we may
not be shaken. Seest thou how he shews that nothing is of

Ver. 15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the
traditions which ye have been tauqht, whether by word or

by Epistle, but many things also unwritten, and in like
manner both the one and the other are worthy of credit.
Therefore let us think the tradition of the Church also worthy
os credit. It is a tradition, seek no farther. Here he shews
that there were many who were shaken.

Again a prayer after an admonition. For this is truly to
