111010 011161 than this? wealth then, seeing it works these
effects in the soul, how can it be honourable ?

But this power is a more grievous thing than the diseasev
itself3 as sor one in disease not to be obedient to the phy-
sician's injunctions is a more serious evil than the being
‹liseas0d3 and this is the case with wealth, seeing 11 creates
inflammation 111 every part of the soul‚ and forbids the
physicians to 001116 near it. So let us not felicitate these on
1110 50016 of their power, but pity the-1113 for neither were I
to see a dropsical patient lying, and nobody forbidding
him to take his fill of drinks and meats that are harmful‚
would I felicitate him because of his power. For not in all
cases is power a good thing, nor are honours either, sor these
too fill 0116 with much arrogance. But if thou wouldest not
choose that the body should along with wealth contract
such a disease, how comest thou to overlook the 50111 when
contracting not this scourge alone, but another also ? For it
is on fire all over with burning severs and inflammations, and
that burning sever none 01111 quench, for wealth will not
allow of this, having persuaded it that those things are gains,
which are really losses‚ such as not enduring any one, and
doing every thing at will& For no other soul will one find
so replete with lusts so great and so extravagant, as theirs
who are desirous of being rich. For what silly trifles² do
they not picture to themselves! One may see these devising
111016 extravagant things than limners of hippocentaurs, and
chimaeras, and dragon-footed things, and Scyllas, and
11101151615. And if you were to give a picture of one lust of
1110115, neither Scylla, nor chimaera, nor hippocentaur will
appear any thing at all by the side of such a prodigy; but
you will find it to contain every wild beast at once.

And perehance some one will suppose that I have been
myself possessed of much wealth, seeing Ι 11111 50 11116 10 what
really comes ol'it. lt is reported of 0110, (for I will first con-
firm what I have said from the legends³ of the Greeks)—it is
reported amongst them of a certain kin g, that he became so inso-
lent in luxury, as to make a plane tree of gold ¹¹, and a sky above
it, and thero sate, and this too when invadin g a people skilled
