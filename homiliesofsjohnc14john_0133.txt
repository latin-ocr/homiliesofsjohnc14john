Timothy likenzz'uded with lma. Hats- disinterestedness. 103

none of those whose care is like mine, none who will natu· Hom.
rallyl care for you. Had he then none likeminded of thosel IX:
who were with them? Not one, and what means this? N one 07»an
who has yearnings and takes thought for you as I do. No
one will lightly choose, he means, to make so long ajourney
for this purpose. Timothy is the one with me who loves
you¹'. For I might have sent others, but there was none like
him. This then is 111111 likemindedness, to love the disciples
as the master loves them. Who, says he, will naturally² care2yvnm'm
sor you, that is, as a father,f0r all seels their own, ‘not the Phil. 2,
things& which are ι10808 Christ'S, their own comfort, their ownm·
safety. This too 110 writes to Timothy. But why doth he
lanient such things as these? To teaeh us his hearers not
10 sall in like sort, to teach his hearers not to seek for remis·
51011 from toil, for he who seeks remission from 1011, 500115 1101
1110 things that are Chrisffs, but his own. We ought to be
prepared against every toil, against every distress.

Ver. 22. Ye lmow the proofof him, that as a son with the
father, he hath served with, me in the Gospel.

And that I speak not at random, ye yourselves, he says,
know, that as a son with the fizther, he laath. servecl with. me
ἐπ the Gospel. He presents then Timothy to them, and with
reason, that he might enjoy much honour from them. This
too he does when he writes to the Corinthians, and he says‚1 Cor.
Let 110 man therefore despz'se him,sor he wem-heth the work ¹6⁷ ¹⁰·
Of the Lord as I also do. This he said not as cai-ing for
him, but for those who receive him, that they might receive
a great reward.

Ver. ⁶23. Him, then, he says, I hope ίο semlpresenffly, 80
soon as I shall see how it will 90 with me, that 15, when I
see where Ι stand, and what end my affairs will have.

Ver. -24, But I {rust in the Lord that I also mysegfshall
come shortly.

I am not therefore sending him, as though I myself would
not come, 11111 that I may be of good eourage when I know
your state, that even in the mean time I may not be ignorant
of it. But I {reme} in the Low-cl, says he, that is, God willing. (Ο)
See how he depends in all 011 God, and speaks nothing of his ”

own mind.
ἢ Or, ί the one who loves you with me‚' i. e. ‘ as I.'
