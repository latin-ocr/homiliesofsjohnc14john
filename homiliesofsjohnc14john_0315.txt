HOMILY IX.

Cot. iii. 16, 17.

Let the word of Christ dwell in yon riclely in all wisdom,·
teacleiny and admonislzing] one another in psalma and
hymns and spiritual scmqs, sinqinq with, yrace in your
bearis 1¹0 the Lord. And whatsoever W? do in <word or
deed, do all ‘in the name os tlee Lord Jesux, yles-inq tleanlss
to God and the Falleer by Hz'm.

HAVING exhorted them to be thankful, he shews also the
way. And what is this? That, ofwhich 1 have lately dis-
coursed to you. And what saith he? Let {lae word quhrist
dwell in yon rz'clzly; or rather not this way alone, but another
also. For I indeed said that we ought to reckon up those
who have suffered things more terrible, and those who have
undergone sufferings more grievous than ours, and to give
thanks that such have not fallen to our lot3 but what saith
he ? Lec the word qulerist derel! ίη you νίς-ἦρ] ; that is, the
teachin g, the doctrines, the exhortation, wherein He says, that
the present life is nothing, nor yet its good things. For ifwe Mat. 6,
consider this, we shall yield to no hardships whatever. Let 27125· &⁰⁶
dzcell in you, he saith, richly, not simply dwell, but with great
abundance. Hearlzen ye, as many as are worldly‘, and have the ¹ not in
charge os wife and children 3 how to you too he commits espe- {¹93ss
eially the reading of the Scriptures 3 and that not to be done
lightly, nor in any sort of way, but with much earnestness.
For as the rich in money can bear fine and damages, so he
that is rich in the doctrines of philosophy will bear not
poverty only, but all [other] calamities also easily, yea, more
easily than the other. For as for him, by discharging the
fine, the man who is rich must needs be impoverished, and
found wanting-²¹, and if he should often suffer in that way,

'¹ ἰλεσγχίσέαι, not in money to pay, may be, ‘must be in process of being
hut in power to prevent loss. Or it found wanting!
