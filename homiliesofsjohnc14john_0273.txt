in its bessy, without his perishing? Is it not void of reason, HJM·
and its motions without control ? How spared it the righte- ⁰
0113 man? How was it that the heat did not suffocate him?
How was it that it putrefied him not? For if to be in the
deep only, is past contriving‚ to be both in the creature's
bowels, and in that heat, is very far more unaccountable.
For how breathed he the air in that place? How did the
respiration suffice for two animals? And how did it also
vomit him forth unharmed? And how too did he speak?
And how too was he sels-possessed, and prayed? Are not
these things incredible? If we test them by reasonings, they

are incredible, if by saith, they are exceeding credible.

Shall I say something more than this ? The wheat in the
earth's bosom (lecayS, and rises again. Behold marvels,
opposite, and each surpassing the othei-3 inarvellous is the

rising again. W'here are they that disbelieve the Resurrection
and say, This bone how shall it be cemented to that? and
introduce such like silly tales. Tell me, how did Elias ascend
in a chariot of fire ? Fire is wont to burn, not to carry alost.
How lires he so long a time? In what place is he? Why
was this done ? Whither was Enoch translated? Lives he 011
like food with us? and what is it hinders him from being
here? Nay, but does he not eat? And wherefore was 110
translated? Behold how God schooleth us by little and little.

He translated Enoch 3 no very great thing that. This in-
structed us sor thc taking up of Elias. Again, He shut in Noe Gen. 7,
into the ark ; nor is this either any very great thing. This in· 16.
structed us for the shutting up of the prophet within the whale.

Thus even the things of old stood in need of forerunners ancl
types. For as in a ladder the first step sends on to the
second, and from the first it is not possible to step to the
fourth, and this sends one on to that, that that may be the

way to the next3 and as it is not possible either to get to the
second before the first; so 3130 13 it 11010.

And observe the signs of signs, and thou wilt discern this
in the ladder which Jacob saw. Αόουθ, it is said, the Lord fleu-28,
