Why lle was williny to stay on earth. 43

And what excuse is left to us? ofttimes it happens that a HOM-
man who possesses a little and poor city, chooses not to de· 1V.
part to another place, preferring his own rest. Paul might
depart to Christ, and would not depart to Christ, (Christ
whom he so desired, as for his sake, to choose even hell,) but
still remained in the contest on behalf of man. What excuse
shall we have? May we then even make mention of Paul?
Look to his deeds. He shewed that to depart was better, to
persuade them not to grieve: he shewed them, that if he
remained, he remained for their sake, that it came not to pass
according to the wicked desiresa of those who plotted against
him. He subjoined the reason, that he might secure their
belief. For if this is necessary, that is, I shall by all means
remain, and I will not remam simply, but willa you. For
this is the meaning of the word, leontinae with, i. e. I will ¹ σνμζα-
see you. For what cause? For your ιἡ(νίΙιεφ-αωισε ancl joy os gamm
ιἠιίΐΙι. Here too he rouses them, to take heed unto them-
selves. If, says he, for your sakes I abicle, see that ye shame
not my abicling. For yourficrtleercmce, I have chosen to
remain, when I was about to see Christ. I have chosen to
remain, because my presence advances both your saith and
yourjoy. What then? Did he remain for the sake of the
Philippians only? He stayed not for their sake only, but
this he says, that he may shew regarcl to9 them. And how ‘nuqua-115-
were they to advanco in saith? That you may be more σῃ·
strengthened, like young fowl, who need their mother until
their feathers are set. This is a proof of his great love. In
like sort, we rouse some of you, when we say, for your sake
have I remained, that I may make you good.
