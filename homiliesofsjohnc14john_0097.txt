exhorting the free to obey the free, to what purpose could he VI.
bring forward the subjection of a servant to a master? of a
lesser to a greater? He says not, ‘⁶ Let the lesser bc subject
to the g1·eater,’⁷ but ye who are of equal honour with each
other be ye subject, each esteeminy other better ilcan them-
selves. Why then did he not bring forward the obedience
of the wife, and say, As the wife obeys her husband, so do
ye also obey. Now if he did not bring forward that state in
which there is equality 31111 liberty, since in that the sub-
jection is but slight, how much less would 116 have brought
forward the subjection of a slave? I said above, that no one
praises a man sor abstaining froin evil, nor even mentions
him at all; no one who desires to praise a lnan for continence

the form of an Angel, neither 1135 3 116351 1116 form of a man.
How then should the Son?

Now in our own case, since we men are of a compound
nature, form pertains to 1116 body, but in the case of a simple
and uncompounded nature it is altogether of the substance.
But if thou contendest that he speaks not of the F ather,
because the word is used without the article, I say that in
many places this is meant, though the word be used without
the article. Why say I, in many places? for in this very
place he says, He tlzouylet it not robbery to he equal with.
God, using the word without the article, though speaking of
God the Father.

overwhelm your minds. Meanwhile remember what has
