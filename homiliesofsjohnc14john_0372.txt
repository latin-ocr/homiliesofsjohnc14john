1 Tages. but it is when we ourselves also are on the alert. And what

--l' ¹’ need, you say, have I os the prayer of others, is I am on the

alert myseff, and do not place myself in a situation to need

it? Ι (10 not wish that you should3 but we are always in

need os it, if we think rightly. Paul did not say, what need

have Ι os prayer? and yet those who prayed were not worthy

of him Ρ, 01· rather not equa] to him, and you say, what need

have l os prayer? Peter did not say, that need have I of

Aets1-2,1)1·aycl·‚ for prayer, he says, was made without ceasiny of

have Ι of prayer? On this account thou needest it, because

thou thinkest that thou hast no need. Yea, though thou

become as Paul, thou hast need of prayer. Do not exalt

profit the Jews? Did he not thriee (lraw nigh to God, and

profit Saul? Did he not mourn for him even to 1115 last day,

and not merely pray for him only? that did he profit the

prayers then, you say, profit nothing? They profit even

greatly: but it is when we also (10 something. For prayers
