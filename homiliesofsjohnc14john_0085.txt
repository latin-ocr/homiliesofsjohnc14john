A broken spirit. Joseph’s leumilz‘ty. 55

cient to destroy all strife, who shall break down the safe-
guard, when it is shewn by both ? Not even the devil himself.
The defence is threefold, and fourfold, yea manifold, sor
humility is the cause of all good3 and that you may learn this,
listen to the prophet, saying, For Thou clesirest not sacrifice, Ps. 51,
else would I [sive it: Thou clelz'ylztest not in burnel offeriny. 16· ¹7·
The saerzfices of God are α brolcen spirit, a broken and a
contrite beart, O God, Thou wilt not despise. He does not
