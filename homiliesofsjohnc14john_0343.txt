How to share the crowns of thre Samis. 313

dragged to the stadium? Hast thou not entered into the HOM-
lists? It is another that strips himself, another that wrestles3 XL
but if thou be so minded, thou too shalt be a sharer. Anoint

him, become his favourer and partizan1‚ from without theummzn
lists shout loudly for him, stir up his strength, refresh his {22:2⁰sp
spirit. It follows that the same things should be done in all

 

other cases. For Paul stood not in need, but he spoke in
order to stimulate them. Thou therefore with all others, stop
the mouths of those who would abuse such an one, procure
favourers for him, receive him as he cometh forth with great
attention, so shalt thou be a sharer in his crowns, so, in his
glory3 and if thou do no other thing, but only hast pleasure
in what is done, even thus thou sharest in no common degree,
for thou hast contributed love, the sum of all good things.

For if they that weep seem to share in the grief of those
in sorrow, and gratify them mighti]y‚ and abate the excess of
their woe, much more do they also that rejoice with others,
make their pleasure greater. For how great an evil it is not
to have companions in sorrow, hear the Prophet saying,
And I lookedsor some to [ament with me, ancl there was E. V.
none. Wherefore Paul also saith, qu‘oice with them that do ἓξὲξ)
reson-e, and weep with tlzem tlzat weep. Increase their 20: ’
pleasure. If thou see thy brother in good esteem‚ say not, {³2⁰¹}
‘ the esteem is his, why should I 1·ejoioe.' These words are '
not those of a brother, but of an enemy. If thou be so
minded, it is not his, but thine. Thou hast the power of
making it greater, if thou be not downcast, but pleased, if
thou be eheerful, ifjoyous. And that the thing is so, is evi-
dent from this3 the envious envy not those only who are in
good esteem, but those as well who rejoice at their good
esteem, so conscious are they that these also are interested
in that good esteem3 and these are they who do glory most
in it. For the other indeed blushes when praised exceedingly3
but these with great pleasure pride themselves upon it. See ye
not in the case ofwrestlers, how the one is crowned, the other
is not crowned3 but the grief andthej oy is amongst the favourers
and disfavou1·ers³‚ these are they that leap, they that caper?
