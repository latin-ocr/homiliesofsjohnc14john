Return of the Prodiyal son our example. 137

We were born, we were nurtured, we were benefited, why Hom.
do we fly from our Benefactor? He then, Who hath done all XI.
these things, giveth us strength too, for it was not possible,
that they who are bowed down by the disease should endure
it, did not He Himself give us the strength. He gave us
remission of our sins, we set the gift at nought. He gave us
weahh, we scattered it, we devoured it all. He gave us
strength, we wasted it. He gave us grace, we quenched it;
and how? we consumed it upon nought that was fitting,
we used it for no useful end. These things have destroyed
us, and what is more dreadful than all, when we are in a
foreign country, and feeding on husks, we say not, Let us
return to our Father, and say, Use have simzed ayainst Luke
Heaven, and ayainst Tlcee. And that too, when we have so 15, 18·
loving a Father, who so eagerly desires our return, that if we
will only leave our sins, if we will only return to Him, He
will no longer bear to call in question our former deeds, only
let us quit them. lt is sufficient apology with Him, that we
have returned. What say Ι, He will not call in question?
Not only He Himself calls not in question, but if another
does so, He stops his mouth, though the accuser be one of
good repute. Wherefore, let us return! How long do we
stand afar off? Let us perceive our dishonour, let us be
sensible of our vileness. Sin makes us swine, sin brings
famine to the soul3 let us regain ourselves, and be sober
again, and return to our former high birth, that we may
obtain the good things which are to come, by the grace and
love of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom, &c.
