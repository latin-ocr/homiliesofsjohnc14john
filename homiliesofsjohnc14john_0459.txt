thousand crimes in avenging himself on his enemies.

For a wicked man, who despairs of his life here, pays no (2)
regard even to him who is invested with the purple. He
therefore who was persuaded that he must at all events die
would both be revenged upon his enemy, and after having
first satisfied his own soul, so would meet his end. Let me
mention also a third thing. Those who are fond of lise, and
vehemently attached to the things of this world, would be 3¹‘Jfff‘
ruined by despair and grief. For if any of the young knew en a ⁶
that before he reached old age, he should meet his end, as
the most sluggish of wild beasts, when they are taken,
become still more sluggish from expecting their end, so
would he also be affected. Nor would even the men that
are courageous have their reward. For if they knew that
after three years they would certainly die, what reward would
they have, for daring in the face of dangers? For any one
might say to them, Because you are confident of three years
of life, for this reason you throw yourselves into dangers,
knowing that it 13 1101 possible for you to perish in any other
way. For he, that expects from each danger that he may
come by his death, and knows that he shall live indeed, if he
does not expose himself to peril, but shall die if he attempts
such and such actions, he gives the greatest proof of his zeal,
and of his contempt for the present life. And this I will
make plain to you by an example. Tell me, if the patriarch
Abraham, soreknowing that he should not have to sacrifice
his son, had brought him to the place, would he then have
had any reward? And what if Paul, soreknowing that he
should not die, had despised dangerS, would he have been at
all admirable? For so the most spiritless would rush into
the fire, if he could find any one he could trust to ensure
his safety. But not such were the Three Children. For

Ye see how many advantages there are, and yet there are
more than these that arise from not knowin g the time of our
end. Meanwhile it is sufficient to know these. On this
