appreloendedfd He speaks of the prize, but if he who had
endured such sufferings, he who had per‚secuted he who had
in Ιιῑηι lle( clytus] ql the Lord ‹Ia-5113, was not yet confident
about 11111 resurrection, what can we say? What meaneth,
‚it I necry apprehend 9 What Ι 1161016 531(1. Is Ι maJ attam
to the ›·es·m··‘'1ecl10n (s the (lead. If Ι may apprehend, he
saith, His resurrecti0n3 i. e. If Ι may 116 31116 to endure so
great things, if I may 116 31116 10 imitate Him, if I may be
able to become conformcd to Him. For example, Christ suf-
fered many things, He was spit upon, He was stricken, was
scourged, at last He died. This is the entire course.
Through all these things it is needful that men should
endure the whole contest, and so 601116 10 His resurrection.
He meaneth either this, or that if I am thought worthy to
share the accepted resurrection, which is in confidence, Ι
11351611 10 His resurrection. For if Ι 3111 31116 10 endure all the
contests, I shall 116 able also to attain to His resurrection,
and to rise with glory. For not as yet, saith he, am I wor-
thy, but I follow qsler, {f that I may apprehend. My life is
still one of contest, I am still far from the end, 1 am still dis·
tant from the prize, still I run, still 1 pursue. And He said
not, 1 run, but J purgem, and rightly so. For we know with
what eagerness a 111311 pursues. He sees no 0116, 116 thrusts
aside with great violence all who would interrupt his pursuit.
He collects together his mind, and sight, and strength, and'
soul, and body, looking to nothing else than the prize. But
if Paul, who so pursued, who had suffered 50 many things,
yet saith, gif I may atsaiw, what must we say, who have re-
laxed our efforts? Then to shew that the thing is of debt, he
saith, For which also I (me apprehendat of Chris-t ιῙθειιε. Ι
was, he saith, of the number of 1116 1051, I gasped for breath,
I was nigh dead, God apprehendet] me. For He pursued
us, when we fled from Him, with all speed. By this 116
points out all those things3 for the words, I am appreleended,
shew tho earnestness of Him who wishes to apprehend us,
our great aversion to Him, our wandering, our flight from
Him.
