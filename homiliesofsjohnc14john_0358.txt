3:28 Virqln modes-ly. llIyslery qs the Illarriafse Union·

Coros. Scest thou not how in kings' houses, the honoured arc

-4’ 10. within, about the king, the unhonoured without? Do thou

(5) too be within about the bride. But remain in the house in

chasteness‚ expose not thy virginity. Either company is

standing by, the one to shew of what sort she is whom they

arc giving up, the other in order that they may guard her.

Why disgraeest thou the virgin estate ? For if thou art such

as this, the same will the bridegroom suspect her to be. If

thou wishest to have men in love with thee, this is the part

of saleswomen, green-grocerS, and handicrafts-people. Is not

this a shame? To act unseemly is a shame even though it

be a king's daughtern. For doth her poverty stand in the

way ? or her course of life? Even if a virgin be a slave, let

Gal. 3, her abide in modesty. For in Christ ιῙεειιε there is neither

What? is marriage a theatre? It is a mystery and a type
of a mighty thing3 and even if thou reverence not it, reverence
that whose type it is. This, saith he, is (ι qreat mystery, bul
Ι spealc concerniny Christ ancl the Church. It is a type of
the Church, and of Christ, and dost thou introduce harlots at
it ? lf then, saith one, neither virgins dance, nor the married,
who is to dance ? No one, for what need is there of
dancing? In the Grecian inysteries there are dancings, but
in 01115, silence and decency, inodesty, and bashfulness. A
great mystery is being celebrated: forth with the harlots!
sorth with the profane 1 How is it a mystery ? They come
together, and the two make one. VVherefore is it that at his
entrance indeed, there is no dancing, no cymbals, but great
silence, great stillness3 but when they come together, making
not a lifeless image, nor yet the image of any thing upon
carth, hut of God Himself, thou introducest so great an
uproar, and disturbcst those that are there ⁰, and puttest the
soul to shame, and consounclest it? They come, about to
110 made 0110 body. See again a mystery os love! If the
two become not one, so long as they continue two, they make
not many, but when they are come into oncness, they then
make many. What (10 we learn from this? That great is
the power os union. The wisc counsel of God at the begin-
