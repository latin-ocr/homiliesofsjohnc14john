much more was it even reasonable that they should be
alarmed about Paul,) therefore in the opening of the Epistle

he offers them much consolation about his bonds, shewing
that they should not merely not be alarmed‚ but even rejoice.
Then he also gives them counsel about unanimity and hu-

readiness for the saith 3 inasmuch as the very jailor‚ (and you
know it is a business full of all wickedness‚) did at once, upon
one miracle, both run to them, and receive Baptism with all
his house. For the miracle that took place he saw alone,
