The yist ofyrace binds us to abide with God. 135

not that I 1150 irony here, for as before the appearance of Hom-
Christ we fied from God, thus we fiee from Him now too. XI.
For we 0311 Ηο0 from God, not in place, for He is every where,
but by our deecls3 and that we cannot fly from Him, hear the
Prophet, when he sayS, PVleitleer shall I qo from Tlay Spc'rc't, ξε· 139,
or wlez'ther shall Ifleefrom Thy presence? How then can ⁸
we fiy from God? Even as we can become distant from God,
even as we can be removed afar off. They that aresarfrom ΡΞ· 73,
leee, it says, shall perish. And again, Have not your ini- {27:592
quities separated between, Me and you? How then 0011105
this removal, how 0011105 this separation? In purpose and
soul: for it cannot be in place. For how could one fiy
from Him who is every where present? The sinner then flies.
This is what the Soripture saith, Tlee wicked fleetlt when Prov.
no man pur-suella lee'm. We eagerly ΗΥ from God, although He 28, l*
alway pursueth 115. The Apostle hasted, that he might be
near Him. We haste, that we may 110 far off.

Are not these things then worthy of lamentation? Are not
these things worthy of tears? Whither fliest thou? WVretched
and miserable man, whither fiiest thou from thy Life and thy
Salvation? If thou ΗΥ from God, with whom wilt thou take
refuge? If thou fly from the Light, whither wilt thou cast
thino eyes? If thou fly from thy Life, whence wilt thou
hencel'orth live? Let us ΗΥ from the enemy of our Salvation!
W'hensoever we 5111, we ΗΥ from God, we are as runaways,
we depart to a foreign land. As he who consumed his pa-
ternal goods and departed into a foreign land, who wasted
all his father's substance, and lived in want. We too have
substance from our Father3 and what is this? He hath freed
us from our sins3 He hath freely given to 115 readiness,
patience3 He hath freely given to 115 the Holy Ghost
in our Baptism3 if we waste these things, we shall henceforth
be in want. For as the sick, as long as they are troubled
with severs, and badness of their juices, are unable to arise or
work, or do any thing, but if any one sets them free, and
brings them to health, if they then work not, this comes from
their own sloth. Thus too is it with us, a heavy disease
and grievous sever lay upon 115. We lay not upon a bed,
but upon wickedness itself, cast away in crime, as on a dung-
hill, full of soreS, and evil odours, squalid, wasting away,
