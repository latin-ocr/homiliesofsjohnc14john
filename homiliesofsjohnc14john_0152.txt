trifle, answcrs the samo or even a better purpose to him, and
those clothes, which obligo a man to pay down much gold,
do only tho same thing, is not this great superabundanco so
much loss? For it has added nothing in respect of its use
and service, whereas your purse is emptied of so much the
moro gold, while the thing has only the same use and em-
ployment. You, then, who have richcs, have purchased one
which cost an hundred pieces of gold, or even more, whereas
the poor man has bought one for a trissing sum of silver. Do
you perceive the loss? No, sor your pride will not lot you
see it. Would you have us make out this account in the
case of the gold ornaments too, which men put alike
about their horses and their wives? For besides the
other evils, the possession of money makes fools of men3 thus
they account their wives and horses to be worthy of the same
honour and ornaments, for both are the same3 and they
would make themselves finer by the same means as the very
beasts that carry them, or as the very skins of the awnings,
wherein they are borne. What now is the 1150 of decking
out a mule or a horse with gold? or the lady, that has such
a weight of gold and jewels about her person, what does she
gain? ‘ But the ornaments are never worn out,' he answers.
Now those that are knowing in such things declare that, to a.
great degree, they are liable to this very mischief: that in
the baths very often both the jewels and gold ornaments lose
much of their value. But be it 5ο, and grant that they are not
injured‚ tell me, what is the gain? And how is it when they
drop out, and are lost? is there no loss sustained? And how
when they draw down upon you envy and intrigues? is there
no loss then? For when they do the wearer no good, but
rather inflame the eyes of the envious, and act as an incite—
ment to the robber, do they not become loss? And again,
say, when a man may use them for a serviceable purpose,
but is unable 011 account of the extravagance of his wife, and
is obliged to starve and to stint himself, that he may see her
arrayed in gold, is it not a matter of loss? For it was on this
account that goods have their name srom use‘, not that we
