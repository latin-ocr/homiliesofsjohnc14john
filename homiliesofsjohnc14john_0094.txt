ls it then not said of the Father? By no means. For the
seque] suffers it not which says, Tlee appearing] of the (sreat
God, (md our Saviom· Jeszc-s· Christ. See, the Son is great
also. How then speakest thou of small and great?

Listen to the Prophet too, calling him Tlee Illos-senam* of
qreat eoem-rel. ΤΙιε ᾹΙεδεεηῃθν of φ·εαί σοῑιηερί, is He not
great Himself ? The miqlzty God, is He small and not
great? that mean then these shameless and bold men when
they say, that being small He is a God? Ι repeat ofttimes
wliat they say, that ye may the more avoid them. He being
a lesser God seized not for Himself to be like the greater
God! Tell me now, (but think not that these words are inine,)
if He were, as they say, lesser, and far inferior to the Father
in power, how could He possibly seize to Himself equality
with God? For an inferior nature could not seize for him-
self admission into a greater3 for example, a man could not
seize on being equal to an angel in nature; a horse could not,
though he wished it, seize on being equal to a man in nature.
But besides all that, I will say this too. What does Paul
wish to establish by this example? You will surely say, to
lead the Philippians to humility. To what purpose then
would he have brought sorward this example? For no one
who would exhort to humility speaks thus3 “ Be thou
humble, and think less of thyself than of thine equals in
honour, for such an one who is a slave has not risen against
his master. Do thou imitate him.'’ This, any one would
say, is not humility, but arrogance ¹¹¹. Leam ye what humility
is, ye who have a devilish pride! What then is humility?
To be lowly minded. And he is lowly minded who humbles
himself, not he who is lowly by necessity To explain what I
say, and do ye attend3 he who is lowly minded, when he
has it in his power to be high minded, is humble,but he who
is so because he is not able to be high minded, is no longer
humble. For instance, If a King subjects himself to his own
officer, he is humble, for he descends from his high estate3
but if an officer does SO, he is not lowly minded3 sor how?
he has not humbled himself from any high estate. It is not

of LXX omit the latter part of ls. 9, calling it humility were arrogance, or
6. probably because it was not under· ‘ this is not a question of humility bnt
