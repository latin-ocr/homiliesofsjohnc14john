lee narrow Way hard to tlte bulky and encumbered. 437

But we, chaining ourselves down with numberless cares, HOM-
and carrying with us the numberless burdens of this life, IX.
staring about, and looselyrambling, how do we expect to travel
in that narrow road? He has not merely said that marrow is Matt. 7,

is, exceedingly narrow. And this we also do in things that
are quite objects of wonder. And again, sti-aitened, he says, mem.-

11 marrow. For when we are bound to give an account of our
thoughts, words, and actions, and all things, truly it is nari-ow.

But we make it more narrow, spreading out and widening our-

difficult to every one, but especially to him who is incumbered Μ’
with fat, as he who makes himselflean will not perceive its

pinched, will not be discouraged at its pressure.

Let not any one therefore expect that he shall see heaven
with ease. For it cannot be. Let no one hope to trave] the
narrow road with luxury, for it is impossible. Let no one
travelling in the broad way hope for lise. When therefore
thou seest any one luxuriating in baths, in a sumptuous
table, with attendance of guards, think not thyself unhappy,
as not partaking of these things, but lament for him, that he
is travelling the way to destruction. For what is the advan-

the injury of that straitness, when it leads to rest? Tell me,
if any one invited to a palace should wall< through narrow
ways painful and precipitous, and another led to death should
be dragged through the midst of the market-place, which
shall we call happy? which shall we commiserate? Him,
shall we not, who walks through the wide road? So also
now, let us think happy, not those who are luxurious, but
those who are not luxurious. These are hastening to hea-
ven, those to hell.

 

And perhaps indeed many of them will even laugh at the
things that are said by us. But I most of all lament and
bewail on this account, that they do not even know what
